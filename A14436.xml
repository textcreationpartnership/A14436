            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From the condition of grace, to the ſtate of perdition. From the vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of chriſtians, to diuiſion of Nereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the light of pure knowledge, to the darkenes of foule ignoraunce.</p>
            <p>From the trueth of antiquitie, to the falſhode of nouelties. From faythfull beleuyng, to carnall reaſonyng. From ſauing Chriſt, to deceyuing Antichriſt. Thus they agree together, that in all thinges they be vtterlye vulike. The one is of God, and ledeth to Chriſt and trueth. Thother is of the deuyll, and leadeth to Antichriſt and hereſie. The one grounded in fay the ſubdueth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, thother ledde by reaſon confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faith. The one beleueth reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye what reaſon can not comprehende, thother impudently alledgeth reaſon faith to reprehende. Betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther is no amitie, no ſemblaunce, no agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:9"/>no felow ſhip: but continual war one againſt another. Nowbeit for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as no vntrueth can deceaue, but by colour of trueth: no hereticall poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can beguyle, but when it is geuen in fourme of medicine, therefore thys whoriſh churche laboureth by al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to reſemble in vtter ſhewe and countenaunce thother good churche: the rather to ſeduce the improuident, when her falſhode is cloked: the ſoner to catche the ſimple, when her hooke is couered. And this is the matter, why diuers haue been ſo greatlye deceaued of late, and diuers againe wilbe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if vpon this warning thei watch not, and by other menues harmes they beware not. For although this harlot, this deuilliſhe Syuagege, purpoſeth nothinge els, but to incororate you to the deuyll Antichriſt, yet hath ſhe euer more in her mouthe Chriſte, Chriſte. Though ſhe only laboreth to tumble you headlong into hell both body and ſoule, yet doth the continually babble of heauen: though ſhe teacheth nothing but hereſy to ouerthrow the ghoſpel,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:9"/>yet her tongue runneth ſtil of the ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as thoughe ſhee hated hereſye. Thoughe ſhe be whollye of the deuyll and nothing of Chriſt, yet ſhe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth great familiaritie to Chriſt oulie, as thoughe ſhe knewe not the deuyll. Thoughe ſhee lacke no crafte to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert trueth, yet trueth, trueth, is euer her word, as though ſhe lacked crafte. O malicious harlot. O deceauable feinde. O cruel ſtepdame. Come home come home, gentle brethren, to youre louing and tender mothers lay, whiche hath foſtered you from your youthe, and leaue the armes of that cruelſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, whiche will not leaue, if you leaue not, till ſhe hath ſtrangled you. Come home to this leache, that ſhee maye heale you of your foule leprie, wherwith this feinde hath ifected you. Come home to this ſwete nourſe, that you maye ſucke from her breſtes the holſome foode of your ſoules healthe, and comforte: and leaue the ſtinkinge carren wherewith this whore feedeth you. Come home, I ſay, to thys calme and quiet port, where you ſhall finde
<pb facs="tcp:4883:10"/>reſte and tranquillitie of conſcience, whiche the deuyll coutinually toſſeth and tumbleth in reſtles paynes with the tempeſtuous ſtormes of hereticall nouelties. Who is our mother? Wher is our home? No doubt the vniuerſall church is our mother, her lappe is our home. If you be not ther at home, you can not be at home with God. If you acknowledge not her to be your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may not acknowledge God to be your father. To this mother, Mary the mother of her countrye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you. To thys home <hi>Vincent</hi> wyll leade you euen by the hande as it were. If you be not at home with this mother, there can be no health in you, but all diſeaſes: there can bee no knowledge in you, but al ignoraunce: there can be no hoope of lyfe lefte in you, but aſſurednes of deathe. Yea, ye can not be of God, but of the deuyl. <hi>Qui matrem eccleſiam relinquit,</hi>

If you wilbe healthfull, come home and haue it: If you couet knowledge, come home and ſucke it at your mothers breſtes, in forme and maner, as it ſhall pleaſe her and not you. If you wil haue life, come home &amp; bide at home with our louinge mother, where deathe ne hell can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail againſt you. If you wilbe of god, come home and be incorporate into the bodie of God and man Ieſus Chriſte: and then the deuil ſhall haue no power ouer you.

<pb facs="tcp:4883:11"/>heauen. They as vnfaithfull rebelles ſhalbe deſtitute of all heauenlie grace, you as obedient and faithfull children ſhalbe ſupported with the maieſtie of Angels.

But as at home with our mother there is no lacke of trueth, ſo that harlot our cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſtepmother lacketh no crafte to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap and entangle you, no falſhood, no flatteringe to allure and intice you. Come vnto me (ſaith ſhe) for here is Chriſt, here is health, here is ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:11"/>Thus the Ape can ruffle in purple: thus the Aſſe can ſtrowt in the Lyons ſkynne, thus the iarringe Iaye canne counterfeicte the pleaſaunt note of the nightingale. But beware brethren, be not deceaued. It is and euer hath been the practiſe of the deuill and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by coulor of trueth to perſwade falſhood, vnder the cloke of good to bringe in al euil. Our true mother the true church is but one, &amp; in all reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes but one only: one in one vniforme vſe of one Baptiſme &amp; ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, one faith, one ſpirite. This mother, is not a mother of a fewe, but of many: her power is not particular, but vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall: as ſhe is extended through all the foure partes of the earth, &amp; her glorie diffuſed in the whole world. For of her it is ſaied: <hi>Dabo tibi gentes haereditatem tua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; poſseſſionem tuam terminos terrae.</hi> I wyll giue the nations thine inheritaunce and the extremities of the earthe ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be thy poſſeſſion. This our mother the true churche hateth not light, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to lurke in corners, where ſhe maye not be ſeene: but as her power
<pb facs="tcp:4883:12"/>hath euer more been vniuerſall, ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally ſhe hath been at all tymes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte, plaine, and manifeſt.

Whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie the hereticall churche, is of a contrary nature. For ſhe neither is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall, nor at all tymes, but at ſome certaine time, and in ſome one certaine place. And againe ſhe goeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth preuilie, and in her doinges there is no vnitie, no certeintie at all. Her miniſters are diuided, now they dreme one thinge, &amp; nowe an other: this daye they like, to morowe they miſlike: one is againſt an other of them, euen in the higheſt myſteries of Chriſt his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Who liſt to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre their writinges
<pb facs="tcp:4883:12"/>ſhall proue true that I ſaie. Howe be it experience of their doinges, without readinge of their bookes, mighte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs of Englande what thei were, and wherehence they be, that yeres paſt haue been preachers and teachers here amongeſt vs: that haue perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our true mother the vniuerſall churche of Chriſt: and haue ſet vp their lorde Antichriſte, and his hereticall churche. What orders, what forme of religion haue they ſet furth ſins their firſte raigne, that ſhortly after they altered not? Whiche three of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mougeſt them all, that agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their matters? No marueill, for the deuill is their chiefe head, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſerue: and he is full of lyes, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce, diuiſion, and diſcorde. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him their ſcholemaiſters were, Hus, Luther, <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> Decolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Bucer, Melanethon, Tindall, Frythe, whiche in their doctrine agree not one with an other. Such maiſters, ſuche ſcholers come of them. And this diuiſion, this vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie of doctrine, was a manifeſt token that they were
<pb facs="tcp:4883:13"/>not the children of oure true mother the catholike churche, nor miniſters of Chriſt, but the children of the deuill and miniſters of Antichriſt: yea very Autichriſtes. For who ſoeuer ſaith S. Auſten is gone from the vnitie of the catholike churche, he is become Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Thoſe Antichriſtes haue borne a great ſtroke here nowe to longe time in Englande, in whom was no conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, no ſtaye, no ſtedfaſtues of religion and doctrine. Howebeit thei al agreed wel in ſome thinges. They all woulde be as proude, as headdy, as falſe and ſuttle, as the deuill their father, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence they came. They al would haue wyues, longe berdes, and finally no olde trueth, or faſhions: but all newe knackes and fanſies, as their ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters lyked, Bucer. &amp;c. of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were taught. Yet woulde they bere vs in haud y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they wer catholike chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But howe can ye be catholike chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus (ſaith ſainte Auſten in his treatiſe vpon ſainte Iohn his Epiſtle) that do not communicate and agre to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of doctrine and faith, whiche is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:4883:13"/>and vſed through all chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? They woulde be counted true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell, Prophetes, and Apoſtles: yet none of them can ſaye as Paule the Apoſtle ſaied. Our exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion was not to bringe you to error, nor to vncieanes, neither was it with gyle: our conuerſation was not at any time with flatteringe wordes, neither in cloked couetouſnes, neither ſought we praiſe of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ye are witnes and ſo is God, howe holy and iuſtly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable we haue behaued our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues emouge you. This ſaid S. Paule. What can our new Apoſtles ſay? Out of all doubte the verie contrarie, as truly as euer S. Paule ſaid the other. But for feare of Hypocriſie they dyd all their good workes in corners, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might not ſe them. Yet Chriſt ſaid: Let your lyght ſhine before men, that they may ſe your good workes. But thoughe they were not men of manye good workes, yet had they many pretie Aualities, though I ſaie it. For I may lyke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them well to the beaſt called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melopacdus: chiche being but one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth
<pb facs="tcp:4883:14"/>yet many beaſtes, as by hys necke, the horſe: by his feete, the oxe: by his head, the Camell: by his ſpottes in his ſkinne, the Tygre. So theſe late preachers in their ſtoute countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they ſeemed warriers: in their lighte apparell, courtiers: in their familiar talke, rybawdes: in their geſture, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons: in their liuinge, ryotous: in the pulpyt, lying preachers: in their bokes, ſpiteful railers. If they haue not been ſuche as I report them, then ſhowe me what they were, and howe muche ye that haue been their diſciples and ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue profited vnder them, and by their example in godlynes of lyfe, in honeſtie of behauiour, in charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes your neighbours, ſins ye firſt we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your mother the church, &amp; left the auncient orders and cuſtomes of religion, and became gaye Goſpellers after the gyſe of your newe teachers? Beholde your ſelues in the glaſſe of your owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, &amp; tel me trueth. Ye ſay, that they were godly teachers, and that through them ye haue attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a great knowledge of Goddes
<pb facs="tcp:4883:14"/>word. The more knowledge ye haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more godly ye ware of lyfe. For wher the true knowledge of Gods worde is, ther is the true ſpirite of God, which euermore ſterreth &amp; moueth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue wel, according to his knowledge, &amp; the pleaſure of God, whoſe knowledge he doth profeſſe. But in Englande I am perfecte &amp; none of you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſai nay, &amp; ſaie truth: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye haue growen in al wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, as ye haue growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this newe religion, in ſomuche that there was neuer ſuche vnthriftines in ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſuche vnnaturalnes in children, ſuche vnrulines in ſubiectes, ſuche feircenes in enemies, ſuche vnfaithfulnes in frendes, againe ſuche beaſtlynes of myndes, ſuch diſdainfulnes in hartes, finally ſuch falſhood in promiſes, ſuch deceitfulnes in bargaines, ſuche gredy extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch inſatiable couetouſnes, ſuch itollerable pride, as therfore ye are beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e a fable amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. How ſaye ye, is not this true? whiche of you can denaie it? And be theſe the fruites of true knowledge? yea, do not theſe behauiours and vngodlye maners of
<pb facs="tcp:4883:15"/>you, declare manifeſtlie that ye haue of late yeres geuen your ſelues rather to errors, then to trueth: rather to haue forſaken the catholike and pure faieth of our mother the true churche, and folowed the fonde fanſies of a fewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and falſe teachers, to the highe diſpleaſure of God? Will God thinke ye reforme his churche if they were in error, or call his people to knowledge if they had been in ignoraunce, by the miniſters of the deuil, by the preachers of Antichriſt? Or can ye ſai that thei be the miniſters of God, that liue ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye: that they be the preachers of righteouſnes, whoſe dedes are ſo full of vnrighteouſnes: that in compariſon of them, other whom ye called papiſtes might be ſaintes for the honeſtie of their liuinge, and ſobre behauiours, as ye your ſelues haue ſaied many times euen in my hearing? Be not theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Prelates, to be folowed? haue ye done a noble fete trowe ye, to forſake the vniuerſall vnitie of all chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to be at defiaunce with your louing mother the catholike churche, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:4883:15"/>hath foſtred you from your infancie, and without whoſe help, furtherau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and ſuccour, ye cannot be ſaued: for to folow ſuche blinde guides, ſuche groſſe maiſters, as whoſe doctrine hathe brought you in errors, to the high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God: whoſe example of vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clene lyuinge hathe ledde you into all wickednes, to your great ignominie, ſhame and rebuke with all godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? what good haue they done in this realme, either by their preachinge in wordes: or with their teaching by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? Haue thei not broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many good and godlye ordinaunces, and ſet vppe none? Haue they not cauſed for greate concorde and vnitie, great tumult and rebellious ſedition? for godly faſtinge, ryotous feaſting? for deuout praiyng, peuiſhe prating? for due obedience, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull libertie? for peace, Gods plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and inough: warre, dearth &amp; famine more then inough? I write and wepe in my harte to conſidre, what maye be writen of the wretched condition and ſtate that our countrie hath been in of late yeres. Which of you al, yea which
<pb facs="tcp:4883:16"/>of your preachers, (whoſe light ſhould ſhine that the worlde ſhoulde ſee it) which of them I ſaie, hath not been as redye as the worſt diſpoſed of you all, to eate vpon good friday or any other vigill daye, as ſoone the Pigge as the Pikerel, the Capon, as the Carpe: the Chykin as the Cheuen? Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Magiſtrates of this realme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, the wiſedome of the whole worlde thought neceſſarie, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall conſent of Chriſt his churche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the contrary. What ſeruaunt for the moſt parte hath any of you all, that loketh not to haue his brekefaſt, his dyner, and his ſupper, as well vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſtmas eue, as any other daye, or els ye muſt prouide a newe ſeruaunt? Who can blame them? Are thei not as they haue been vſed? Rather then ye would obſerue the ordre of faſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the churche, ye woulde not ſtick at the beginning to giue your ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uauntes one meale more on the faſting daye, then ye woulde on any other day. And where ye would other dayes feede them with milke, butter &amp; cheeſe only,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:16"/>on the faſting daie, they ſhould be ſure to haue fleſhe. Yea and thought it a glorie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye had ſo done, that ye had ſo well reformed your houſeholde, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that popiſhe faſt: calling all thinges popiſhe that was godly. But what haue ye gotten hereby? Surely ye had neuer ſo lytle good ſeruice, and yet ye neuer paide more for it then nowe. Ye had neuer ſuch diſobedient ſeruantes, and yet ye neuer cheriſhed them better then nowe. Why ſo? Before they were better taught then fedde, and of late they haue been full fed and ill taught: Then were they obedient, truſtie and diligent, as thei were taught: and now be they diſobedient, ſlouthful, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtie, as thei be fedde: then were thei well taught workers, and nowe ill fed porkers: then had ye diligent laborers, and now ye haue negligent loyterers. I ſpeake as I heare your ſelues ſaye that haue them. Well, will ye haue a remedy? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> begin where ye left: teach them better and feede them leſſe. And for praying, how it hath decaied, which of you cannot beare witneſſe? Finallye
<pb facs="tcp:4883:17"/>what kinde of wickednes is there that ye haue not aboue other, and what one vertue is there, that ye haue not leſſe then other, that profeſſe the contrarie religion to you? One demaunded of kinge Ageſilans what fruit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the lawes that Lycurgus made had brought vnto the Citie of Spart: marie quod he, <hi>Contemptum vitiorum,</hi> that is, the contempte of vices. But whoo ſhoulde require of me what fruit the innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this realme of Englande, I muſte nedes ſaye as I knowe, <hi>Contemptum vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum,</hi> the contempte of vertues and al godly liuing. If it be true knowledge, that ye bragge your ſelues to haue of Gods worde: came ye not to it by the ſpirite of God? And doth the ſpirite of God increaſe knowledge in you, and decreaſe godlines that ſhoulde be in you according to your knowledge? Is godlie zeale, is the feare of God, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of life, is charitee towardes your neighbours wrought in your hartes without the knowledge of Chriſte his true religion, or els with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:4883:17"/>therof? If it be in the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of worſhippinge God, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie muſt ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that before this innouation you were in better ſtate of knowledge, becauſe your liues were then more agreable to knowledge: and that ſins, ye haue been erroniouſlye taught and deuilliſhelye ſeduced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your dedes &amp; doinges haue euer ſins been more and more vngodly and deuilliſhe. For God did neuer begin to plante a doctrine vnknowen tofore, or renewe a doctrine afore neglected, and forgotten: but by ſuche as were godly and vnſpotted, as in dede expreſſed the ſtrength and vertue of their doctrine, in their life and behauiours. For as S. Ambroſe ſaith, the wordes of teaching do vehementlie moue the hartes of the hearers, when the life of the teacher is not diſſonant. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the authoritie of the preacher firme, ſure, &amp; alewable, when he clencheth his ſayinges in the mindes of the hearers with the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of godly workes. For the iuſte man in his worde and dede is alowed in his ſayinges, this is required in all prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb facs="tcp:4883:18"/>and teachers commonlie, howe much more is it requiſite in them that will preache and teache a newe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen doctrine? and woulde repell and olde knowen and well grounded religion, to plant ſome newe fangled inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion? If thei were moued by God, then no doubte God woulde alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them to doo it orderlie, that is, accordinge as him ſelfe did, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red other to doe. He him ſelfe (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him) <hi>Caepit faeere &amp; docere.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to doe, and then to teach. And he inſtructing his preachers: ſaid who ſoeuer breaketh one of theſe leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and ſo teacheth other, he ſhalbe called the leaſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: but whoſoeuer obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth &amp; teacheth the ſame ſhalbe called great in the kingdome of God. And S. Paule the worthie preacher of Chriſte his trueth, dothe teſtifie of him ſelfe. I doe chaſten my bodie (ſaith he) and bringe it into ſubiection, leaſt perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture while I preache to other, I my ſelfe be made a reprobate. Surely if God woulde innouate or alter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:4883:18"/>ſo longe receiued, by reprobate men: then is he not the ſame that he was, nor one with his promiſe. For when he firſt began to plant the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his ſonne Chriſt, he choſe ſuch miniſters and preachers therof, as for integritie of life, and alſo for diuers miracles (effectuall perſuaſions of anye thinge that they ſhoulde teache) were notable through all the worlde. But our holy preachers beginning to plant a newe religion, or (as they ſaye) renewe an olde doctrine this .xv. C. yeres neglected, lacke both. Thei haue neither good conditions to authoriſe, ne miracles to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme their ſayinges. O, you will ſay vnto me, though they liued not accordinglye, yet was their teachinge good. I ſaie they taughte naughtie &amp; falſe doctrine. How proue I that? becauſe it is contrarie to the faith receiued and taught by our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vniuerſall churche. But they brought the ſcriptures for them ye wil fai. Yea ſo did the deuil, ſo did Arreus, Donate, Sabellius, and as many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes as euer were, to maintaine their
<pb facs="tcp:4883:19"/>doctrine, yet was their doctrine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and blaſphemous: and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture true and mooſt true. But thei al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged the Doctours, and Fathers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſcriptures. They did in dede, but in like ſort and maner as diuers were noted to allege Homers verſes. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hedles, &amp; end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, for whatſoeuer they founde in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the fathers workes, that mighte in any reſpecte ſeeme in apparaunce to mainteine their errors: the ſame wolde thei continuallie chat and charme on, allthoughe in dede it made either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them and their errouious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: or at leaſt, nothinge with them, if they had well waied their workes throughlye as they did not. But they were ſnatchers and patchers only, and only ſnatched here and there a piece to patche vp a botching mater. I mighte well liken them to Apes for diuers qualities that were in them, for as the Ape being neither apt to kepe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> houſe, as doth the maſtie cur, nor fitte to bere burthen, as can the hors: nor meete to turne and till the grounde, as can the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:19"/>Oxe: ſhe only flattereth, ſhe only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to laughter and pleaſure, and with her foliſhe mockes and mowes maketh vs pleaſaunt and merie. So theſe newe fangled preachers, for as much as thei had not the grace neither to kepe home w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their mother, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall churche: and with her to watch and kepe the wardes that her enemies aſſaulte her not, neither to turne &amp; till the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of mans ſoule, that it might be apt to receiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good feéde of whete, whiche their mother woulde haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: neither yet paciontlie to bere the burthen and loode of her motherlie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by faſtinge and praiyng, and to ſuffre the croſſe of her ſpouſe Chriſte, which ſhe would haue leide vpon their ſhowlders: being vnfitte (I ſaye) and vnprofitable membres to theſe good purpoſes and vſes. they became mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of pleaſure, libertie, lyeence and eaſe, and they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues knowrle dope in them all. Whoſe onlie purpoſe was as Traſmus well noteth in his epiſtle to Bylibaldus, <hi>Cenſus, &amp; vxor,</hi> thryuing and wyuing. ergo in this point they be
<pb facs="tcp:4883:20"/>apiſhe. Againe when ſo euer they toke vpon them the handlinge of any good and weightie matter, their handling of it was apiſhelie: for either thei woulde rent and teare it into peices, and make it nought worth, orels by wraſting and wrething of it, they woulde force the ſame to mainteine their principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente <hi>(wyuinge and thriuynge)</hi> and this is apiſhe. Further as of euill commeth good many times, ſo of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came ſome good alſo. For we reade that the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes, plaie, and paſtime that the Ape maketh, driueth away the Agew from the Lyon. In like ſort the foly, the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutious libertie of theſe new fangled preachers haue driuen awaie the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſecuritie from the catholike ſort, and haue been occaſion that they haue giuen them ſelues more earneſtlie to watche and warde for their mothers right, whiche tofore liued as careles without feare of enemies: and here in thei were as profitable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholike, as Apes to the Lyon. Thus thoughe they woulde not abide to be papiſhe, yet were thei ſtil apiſhe. Thei haue loſt
<pb facs="tcp:4883:20"/>but one letter of the name, but they lacke an hundreth good conditions of them, that be ſo named. They will ſay here vnto me, now ye talke at pleaſure of vs: but all this while why haue not you amongeſt you confuted by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and learning our doctrine, if it were ſo euill? I ſaie vnto them, what nede any of vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute your doctrine by argument, whiche the vniuerſall church of Chriſt by conſent, hath long ago co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempued for hereſie? Tuſhe they will ſay againe, you could ſay nothing againſt it. How know ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that when we ſpeake you will not vnderſtand vs, or els your ſelues haue ſo many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that ye will neither voucheſafe vs time to ſpeake, nor your ſelues leiſure to here. Ye are ſo ful of wordes that ye cannot abide vs to ſpeake, and ſoo full of malice, that ye will not ſauer of it, if it ſounde contrarie to your opinion. Ye are made like <hi>Porticus i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Olympia,</hi> which was called <hi>Septiuoca,</hi> hauing ſeuen voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or ſeuen ſoundes, becauſe for one voice it woulde giue many. Soo, you were made <hi>Septiuoci</hi> for one worde you
<pb facs="tcp:4883:21"/>will haue the tellinge of ſeuen ſcore or els the ſprite woulde fume and be in a greate heate: howe be it, manye times and often we haue confuted your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, although you hetherto were not coufuted, which coulde not be, for two cauſes: the one was becauſe you were become heretikes, which will neuer be perſwaded againſt their conceiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Lucifer the heretike confeſſed of his diſciples to S. Hierom. <hi>Vnum ribi confiteor quia mores meorum apprime nom, facilius cos vinci poſſo quàm perſuaderi.</hi> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this one thing to the, for aſmuche as I do ſo well knowe the nature of my diſciples, that to dye for, they will not be perſwaded, rather will they by violent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pulſion be va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed. Next becauſe ye are apiſhe as I ſay. For as the Ape whippeth here and there, and neuer ſtaiethe in one place, lykewiſe pour cuſtome and maner is, ſo to ſterte and whippe from place to place, from matter to matter, from texte to texte, that it is not poſſible to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you in reſoninge. It is an olde ſaying &amp; ſome what to true, Frenſie,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:21"/>Hereſie &amp; Geloſie after that they haue ones crepte into man, they will neuer lightlie out of him againe. Blame me not if I be ſome what quicke. Youre quicke ſpede heretofore requireth no leſſe haſt, Yet am I not ſo quicke to touch you for your euil doinges, which deſerue no fauor, as ye haue been ouer haſtie here afore to depraue vs for ſuch matters as were worthye praiſe and commendation. If ye haue taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in deprauing vs, that offended not take not nowe diſpleaſure, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, for that ye haue offended: ye haue many times ſpoke what ye ought not, and nowe nomaruell, if ye heare what ye woulde not. Who hath not bothe ſene and hard in booke, balet and plaie your ſpurning and kycking, your croing and cryinge, your barkinge and bitinge againſt the faiethfull beliuers and catholike preachers? and why? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſothe for two cauſes. Let Diogenes tell the firſt and I will not ſticke to tel the nexte, One aſked Diogenes what was the cauſe, that ſome men woulde rather giue their almes to the creplte and
<pb facs="tcp:4883:22"/>lazar then to a Philoſopher, marye quod he, becauſe they hope ſoner to be a creple or lazar then to be a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that is, a louer of wiſedome &amp; truethe. Nowe why haue ye ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly inueighed againſt the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Chriſt, and the trueth of hys ſpouſeſſe our mother the churche, and haue extolled the falſe miniſters of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt and the miniſtrie of his harlot the malignant churche? Speake Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes, ſpeake. It is, becauſe they ſoner hoope to be ſtill the falſe miniſters of Antichriſte, then at any time the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preachers of Chriſt: ſoner to go to dwell in hell with the deuill for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye: then to raigne in heauen with god, for true religion. Wel ſaide Diogenes, and by promiſe I muſt tell the nexte cauſe. I haue readde of an vnſkilfull Painter, who hauinge painted on a time in a table home lie and verie euill fauoredly, a companie of croinge coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and beinge preuie of his owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, he commaunded his hoye to driue out al the pultry out of the houſe and that in no wiſe any liuelye Cocke
<pb facs="tcp:4883:22"/>ſhoulde come night the place, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table with his painted cockes ſtode, leaſt the beholder or byer by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and collation of them together, might eſely deprehende the groſſe and rude ignoraunce of the Painter, and ſo hinder the vttraunce of his ware. So, beware ſaide our preachers beware of theſe papiſtes, beware of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtrie, harken not to them. Kepe not companie with them. Trie, fye on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and let them go. Wherfore? The pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath told the cauſe. They were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of their owne wicked ignoraunce. For they feared, &amp; I am out of doubte, that if ye had truely conferred their doctrine and liues with the doctrine and liues of the other good and godlye teachers, whiche they called papiſtes: if ye had quietly and diligently with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of minde wayed well what they haue either ſaied in pulpit or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in bookes: ye had longe agone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the blinde and groſſe ignorance of your guydes, Ye had eſlie found out their treacherie, crafte and falſhood: ye had ſoone tried that al their gaie pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:4883:23"/>wart, was but bumling and fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling peltrie, and not (as they made you beleue) faithfull religion, but deceitful deluſion, not wittie writing, but wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wreſting of well written trueth, not truethfull preching, but rutheful bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of all chriſtian ordres, not right reformacion of thinges amiſſe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelliſhe deformation of thinges that were well, &amp; to be ſhort not repairing, but impairing of the catholike fayth. Alas moſt deere countremen that euer ye ſhould be ſomuch bewitched by that deueliſhe harlot that for her whigge &amp; whay ye ſhould thus leaue the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhinge milke of your louinge mothers breſtes, for the durtie poudle of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane pittes whiche bringeth death, ye ſhoulde forſake the cleane fountaine and well of your mother, where he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

O alas dere frendes ye haue greatly haſarded the wealth of your ſoules, ye haue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the burninge coles of vengeaunce vpon your owne headdes: ye haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt your ſelues awaye for euer, to be tormented body &amp; ſoule amongeſt the foule deuelles of hell in fire euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:23"/>if vpon this callinge ye repent not, and make haſt homewarde into the boſome of your louinge mother. Ye haue ben often called, and fewe of you haue regarded. What pituous plages, what meruelous miſeries, haue not you ſene and mooſt of you felt, ſins ye left the vnitie of the vniuerſal church? And were they not all as Prophetes ſent amongeſt you to put you in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce that ye were from home, that ye were out of the fauor of god? What deſperation hathe there been amonge you? howe manye of you nowe of late yeres, haue died deſperate of Goddes mercie? howe many haue caſte awaye themſelues with their owne violente handes? And was not all this ſuffered to let you vnderſtand, that ye were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t children to your good mother? that ye were no longer mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of that liuely bodie? can the childe deſpaire of the fathers mercie, as longe as he is obedient to the mother? Can he deſpaire to be ſaued by Chriſt, that is a membre of his bodie? no, no. Thus mercifullye by diuers meanes GOD
<pb facs="tcp:4883:24"/>boucheſafed to call you home againe into his dere ſpouſeſſe lappe, into your tender mothers armes. But it hath not moued your ſtonie and ſtouborne hartes. Nowe againe of his meſureles mercy he calleth you. And out of doubt this is the laſte call, this is the laſte ſounde of the trumpet. If ye come not nowe home at this call, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, leaſt he will exclude you out for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and you that would not come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo many callinges, ſhalbe bidden goe at one commaundement <hi>Maledicti in ignem aternum,</hi> accurſed into fire euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Ye haue been called diuerſly by diuers and maruelous plages, and yet ye come not. Nowe laſt of all he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you by a more gentle meane, by his true elect Marye our moſt noble and godly Quene. Whom his inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prouidence hathe preſerued of a ſpeciall purpoſe no doubte, that by her he might reſtore his true churche, of late yeres miſerably vexed. And by her laſt of all, call you home into the folde, that haue longe ſtraied as looſt ſheepe. She remembringe therfore whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreſſe

If ye be not of her traine, if ye be not of her familie, the Spouſe will not knowe you: the Spouſe Chriſte will not admit you where he hath to doe. If ye be not one with the ſpouſeſſe, the ſpouſe &amp; you muſt nedes be two. The ſpouſe and the ſpouſeſſe ſhalbe one in heauen, you and the deuil ſhalde one in hell. Wherfore ariſe, ariſe I ſai.

<pb facs="tcp:4883:26"/>calling you home in ſuch louing wife, where ye maye haue reſt and quietnes, that haue been toſſed with ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries? where ye maie haue remedie of ſo many peſtilent ſores, and vlceres, wherewith your ſoules are infected? Come, come, louinge countree men. For the paſſion of Chriſt make haſt and come. Be not ſlacke in comming, that made ſo great haſt in goinge.

But if ye would awake out of that dead ſlepe and ſee the trueth, then no doubte but ye woulde thinke with me &amp; ſaie with waking Iacob. <hi>Verè hic eſt domus dci, &amp; porta coeli. id eſt.</hi> In dede this is the houſe of God, and the gate of heauen. For be out of doubt, if ye he not of this houſe.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:27"/>ye cannot entre into heauen, where God raigneth. If ye kepe not your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues within the Arke of this vniuerſall churche, ye cannot auoide deſtruction: Ye muſt nedes periſhe bodie and ſoule, Wherefore louinge frendes, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſaued, &amp; to raign with Chriſt, be at home with his ſpouſeſſe. If ye louge to inherite as the children of our heauenly father, deſpice not the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of oure mother the catholike churche. If ye longe to drinke the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water that ſpringeth into euerlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge life, reſorte home to the cleare fountaines of your kinde mother the churche, and abandon the company of heretikes. Leaue their broken and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ceſterues, whiche can holde no water, but poudle &amp; miere. For briefe, if ye deſire to worſhippe God rightly, and to walke in this true religion accordinge to his moſt holy will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then ſtagger not to embrace and folowe the olde religion, newlye reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and ſet furthe by our heauenlye and vertuous maiden Quene. For bee out of doubt there is nothinge in this
<pb facs="tcp:4883:27"/>religion, but what the ſcriptures of God haue occaſioned, the heauenlye ſpirite hath ſuggeſted, our true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the catholike church hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed, the holye &amp; learned fathers of all Chriſtendome haue ſet furth, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of many generall counſelles hath confirmed, the longe ſucceſſion and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Be not aſhamed to come home to your mother the churche, ſith ſhe is not aſhamed to receiue you. Thinke it not vileneſſe to forſake the ſociety of heretikes, that ye maie bee made the children of God. Thinke it no folye to twyne your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues out of the armes of an harlot, whiche will gripe you to deathe, that ye maye ſit in the lappe of ſo tender a mother, whiche will cheriſhe you into life euerlaſtinge. Well it is time I ſee to breake of, for I haue exceded the iuſt meaſure of a Preface. And yet am I

And though I am in doubte how you ſhall lyke my doinges, yet be ye out of all doubte I haue done the ſame of a great zeale, and moſt frendlye affection towardes you all. And I proteſt before God I onlye ſeeke therby your ſoules health.

            </p>
            <p>Moreouer the conſideration of my purpoſe agrieth hereto well. For whereas ones I was toſſed with diuers and boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous waues of the ſecular traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyque, at length Chriſte beynge my helper, I arriued vnto the porte of religion, a mooſt ſure hauen for all menne: that there pullyng downe the combe of pryde and vanitie, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelfe to pleaſe God with the ſacrifice of Chriſtian humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, I mighte happelye auoyde not onely the wrekes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this preſent lyfe, but the inquencheable flames alſoo of the worlde hereafter.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4883:30"/>
            <p>But now I ſhall in the name our lorde, ſette vpon the matter purpoſed. That is, to deſcribe and ſet furth ſuch good leſſons, as by tradition are diriued, by writtinge are lefte vnto vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our auncetours &amp; forefathers: deſirynge to be accepted rather as reporter thereof, then preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge to ſeeme authour of the ſame. And further, I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this ordre in writting: not all, but of all the mooſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie matters to gather and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſe, and that not in fyne and pyked phraſe, but in facile and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſpeche: ſo that the mooſt part may ſeeme rather ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> explicated: rather ſleight lye touched, then exactly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

<pb facs="tcp:4883:31"/>to other, whiche either vpon confidence of their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or reſpect of dutie or office, attempt the lyke enterpriſe. As for me, I intende nothinge els, but to prouide vnto my ſelfe, and for mine own ſingular vſe, a byll of remembraunce, as it were, agaiuſt obliuion: wherby memorie moughte be holpen, whiche I feele nowe to decaye in me. And yet I ſhal endeuour with Goddes helpe to amende, and daylye enlarge the ſame: as my leyſure and oportunitie ſhal ſerue, to recogniſe and recompt ſuche thinges as I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And this to this end I ſay, that if thꝭ my treatiſe (which I make for my ſelfe onely) eſcape my handes, and happe to lyght into the handes of other: that
<pb facs="tcp:4883:31"/>then they carpe not, or raſhelye diſproue any thing therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, whereof is promiſed a reformation and amendement. Nowe therefore to come to the matter it ſelfe) I haue with greate ſtudie and earneſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, manye times ſought, and that of verie many godlye and learned men, howe and by what certaine and generall rule I mighte trye and throughly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the veritie of the catholike faithe, from the falſhood of wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked hereſye, the true preacher of Chriſte, from the falſe miniſter of Antichriſte. And I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of them all, at all tymes thys one onlye aunſwere: that whether I,<note place="margin">A rule.</note> or anye other man woulde perfitely knowe, and perceiue the trecherie, falſhood,<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4883:32"/>
            <p>Wherfore it is verie neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the auoydinge ſo greate daungers of diuers errours &amp; doubtes, that the lyne of the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall ſcripture, be drawen and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted along, according to the rule and expoſition of the catholike churche. Lykewiſe in the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke churche we oughte ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to regard and take hede, that we faythfully hold that, whiche is euery where, alwaies, and of algenerally receiued, obſerued, and beliued: for that is properly catholike:<note place="margin">Catholike.</note> as by the Etimologie of the terme (catholike) doth ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peare, whiche comprehendethe all vniuerſally. And this ſhall we doo,<note place="margin">Vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Auncientie. Conſent.</note> if we enſue and folowe the vniuerſalitie, the auncien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; the conſent of the churche.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:32"/>Theſe thre pointes, he muſt fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely holde that wilbe counted catholike, and deſireth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the faieth of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like churche, with out whiche there is no ſaluation. Of theſe three pointes I ſhall teache as I haue learned. And touchinge the firſte, we ſhall not miſſe to folowe the vniuerſalitie, if we hartely confeſſe &amp; acknowledge that faieth to be the true chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faieth, whiche the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Churche throughoute the whole world dothe confeſſe and acknowledge. Touchinge the ſeconde, we ſhall aſſuredlye fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the auncientie, if we ſtray not from the cenſures and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes of the auncient, holy, and catholike fathers. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the third, we ſhal rightlye
<pb facs="tcp:4883:33"/>folowe the conſent and vnitie, if in that antiquitie we admit, imbrace and allowe the difiniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, iudgementes, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, of all or the mooſt parte of the ſaied holie fathers. Nowe what ſhall the catholike Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian man doo, if any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the churche, hathe deuidid if ſelfe from the communion of the vniuerſall faith? What els ſhoulde he doo, but preferre the helth &amp; ſafetie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body, before the corrupte and peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous membre? What if ſome new contagion inuade the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and laboureth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and corrupte, not a parcell onely, but a whole congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Then let him cleue to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: whiche cannot be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by anye crafte of noueltie.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:33"/>What if in the ſelfe ſame anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, we ſhall trye that twoo or thre, yea whole cities and pro uinces haue erred? Then in any wiſe, he ought to prefer before the raſhenes, temeritie &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a few, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> decrees &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minations of an vniuerſal cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. What if no ſuche decrees of any vniuerſall counſell can bee founde in ſome caſe, as ſome ſuche may befall? Then ſhall he diligently conferre, ſearche, and conſidre the bookes and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the auncient fathers of the churche, and receiue their iudgementes. Whiche, although they were neither of one place, neither of one tyme, yet are one in the communion and faieth of one catholike church. And what ſoeuer theſe ſages wyth one
<pb facs="tcp:4883:34"/>conſent, manifeſtlie haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, written, and taughte, the ſame ought he beleue without all doubt. For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that whiche I haue ſaid, I wyll ſet furthe the ſame one after an other by examples, and declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more at large, leaſt whiles I ſtudy to be ſhort, I ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly paſſe ouer the weight of the matter. In the tyme of <hi>Donate</hi> that heretike,<note place="margin">Donate.</note> of whom ſuche as maintaine his hereſies be called <hi>Donatistes,</hi> what time a great part of Affricke had tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them ſelues headlong into the goulfe of the pernitious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the ſaid <hi>Donate:</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettinge their religion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, preferred the curſed and blaſphemous temeritie of one vayne man, before the vnitie of
<pb facs="tcp:4883:34"/>the churche: then (throughe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke) ſuche as deteſted that prophane ſciſme, &amp; adhered faſt to the vniforme conſente of Chriſtes vniuerſal church, they only of them all mought be ſaid vnto their poſteritie leauinge a ſpeciall fourme howe hereafter the wiſedome of al vniuerſally, ought more to be eſtemed then the madnes of a fewe ſingular perſons, in anye weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning our faieth.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe what time the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilent poyſon of the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Arrians.</note> had infected, not one portion, but almoſt the whole worlde: in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche that in maner all the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of the Latine churche, partlye by force, partly by craft circumuented, were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perplexed and amaſed, what
<pb facs="tcp:4883:35"/>were beſt to be done &amp; folowed in ſo great confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of matters: Then whoſoeuer was the true worſhipper and louer of God, the ſame was not infected with the ſkorfe of that fylthye conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but preferred the auncient faith, and vnitie of Chriſtes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall church, before the new forged trecherie and falſhood of certaine ſingular newe fangled harebraines. And what cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, howe great miſerie dothe enſue innouation of religion, &amp; the bringing in of ſuche newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanglenes, contrarie to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the catholike churche: it is mooſt cleare and verie euident, by that whiche folowed in the time of theſe <hi>Arrians.</hi> For then all kinde of thinges both great and ſmall went to wracke: affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:35"/>cognations, amities, hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, and families were deuided, yea whole cities, peoples, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, nations: And finally the whole Empire of Rome was merueilouſlye diſtourbed. For when that prophane noueltie of the Arrians, as it were ſome <hi>Bellona</hi> or infernall furie (the Emperour himſelfe being firſte bewitched withall) had ones brought all the heades and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the courte in ſubiection vnto that newe lawe: ſeſſed not after to diſturbe, vexe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde all maner of thinges, bothe priuate and publique, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and prophane: without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepaunce of good and badde, to diſquiet and hurte whome ſhe liſted, and howe ſhe liked. Then were wiues violated, widowes

Thus loſing al to wyn Chriſt, ſuffering themſelues willingly to be ouercome of al, that truth might ouercome by them: they haue pourchaced vnto theire name ſuche ineſtunable glorie, that they be mooſt rightlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and accompted, not onlye

            <p>Wherefore this diuine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly example of theſe bleſſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ought to be a ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident vnto all &amp; ſingular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, worthie in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual meditation to be recorded, who in maner of the ſeuenfolde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delſticke, brauſhing w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold light of the heauenly ſpirit, haue foreſhowen vnto all their poſteritee, a verye manifeſt and cleare forme, howe hereafter in al vprores of vaine errours, the vnaduiſed temeritie of fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call innouation ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed &amp; vtterly to be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the authoritie of holy An tiquitie, and by the force of the vniuerſal conſent of Chriſt his
<pb facs="tcp:4883:40"/>churche. This hath not been ſtraunge amonges the fathers of the Churche. For euermore the holyer, the better diſpoſed any haue been, the more erneſt, prompt and ready he hath been alwayes to withſtand newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. Examples hereof are plentie. But to auoide tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I wyll paſſe ouer many, &amp; only recite one, whereby it may be euident vnto all, with howe great care, ſtudie, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the bleſſed ſucceſſion of the Apoſtles haue at all tymes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the integritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion once allowed &amp; receyued, by the conſent of the vniuerſall Churche.<note place="margin">Agrippinus</note> So it was therefore that <hi>Agrippinus</hi> biſhop of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage firſt of all other thought good to be rebaptiſed, contrary
<pb facs="tcp:4883:40"/>to the canon and rule lefte by the Apoſtles, contrarye to the cuſtome or order of the elders, contrary to the general conſent of the Clergie. Which preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of his, rayſed vp ſo much miſchiefe, that therby was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen not onelye matter of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſacrylege to Heretikes, but alſo to certayne catholikes occaſion of errour.</p>
            <p>Howe be it on euerye ſyde eche good man withſtod it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.<note place="margin">Stephen.</note> But <hi>Stephen</hi> of honoura<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble memorie then byſhoppe of Rome, with certayne other godlye men moſt vehementlye of all other did reſiſt that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſye of <hi>Agrippinus.</hi> And in an Epiſtle ſent vnto Affrike vpon that occaſion, he ordeyned that nothinge ought to be altred or
<pb facs="tcp:4883:41"/>renewed, but all thinges to be obſerued and kept as thei were by tradition left. For that holy and prudent father well percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that ther was not the true religion, where all thinges are not receyued in lyke faythe of the children, as they were lefte of the fathers: where we be not led by religion, but we lede religion whether we like. And this is the propertie of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten ſobrutie, and grauitie not to deuiſe new ſectes and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his poſteritie, but with all his power to obſerue the old and holſome lawes receyued of antiquitie. What was then the ende of that buſines rayſed by <hi>Agrippinus?</hi> Forſoth the vſuall and tofore obſerued, the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome was reteyned: the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:41"/>newe deuiſe vtterly refuſed.</p>
            <p>But ye wyll ſay perchaunce,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that ſuche men lacke power and learninge to defende theyr new deuiſed opinions. Yea they were ſo excellent in wit, ſo ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in eloquence, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in numbre: agayne they had ſo greate likelyhode of trueth, and brought ſo many ſentences of the ſcriptures for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (but wrongfully vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded) that aſſuredlye they coulde by no meanes haue been ouermated, had not their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters quailed in them ſelues, as mooſt vntrue and contrarye to the will of God.</p>
            <p>To be ſhorte, what ſhall I ſaye of the decrees paſſed in the counſell kepte by certain in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica. Howe did God fauour the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:42"/>ſame? Were not all thynges therein done, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted as drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, abolyſhed as fables, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and vtterlye refuſed as vntrue and contrarie to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith? And O wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful turne and merueilous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The firſt authours of the ſame opinion are reputed catho like: and the folowers of the ſame are iudged heretikes.</p>
            <p>The maiſters be abſolued, and the diſciples be condempned. The writers of the bokes, out of whiche they falſelye forged their opinion, are made the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the heauenly kingdome: and the auouchers burne in hel. For who is ſo mad that doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but that ſo bleſſed lyght of al holy martyrs and byſhoppes <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Cyprian</note> and his felowſhip, do
<pb facs="tcp:4883:42"/>raigne-euerlaſtinglye with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte in heauen? Agayne who is ſo deuelliſhe and wicked to denaye, that the <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> and other lyke heretikes, that brag that they were led by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and authoritie of the ſaied S. Cyprian to rebaptize, burne with their graundeſyre the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill euerlaſtinglye in hell? And ſurely it ſemeth vnto me that, that counſell in Affrike was promulgate and ſetfurthe euen by the prouidence and will of God: thereby to detect and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the ſhamfull crafte of ſuch hellyſhe heretikes, whoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked faſhion is (when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to patche vp an hereſie in an other mannes name) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the bookes of ſuche aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers (in that point dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Firſte becauſe they feare not to quaffe the poiſon of hereſie, &amp; to open the gappe of damnable error vnto other. Secondelye for that they ſlaunderouſlye re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>newe the memorie of holye men in ſuche matter, and as it were with their prophane hande, do fanne abrode into the ayre the aſhes, whiche were well raked vp, reuiuinge that (not without diffamation) whiche were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

That is to ſaye ſtraunge opinions, whiche they knewe not before. And as that is common, ſo is this very pernicious, when to the ſettyng furth of ſuch ſtraunge errours, ther lacke no colour of ſcholes, no apparell of Rhetoricke, no helpe of knowledge, as thys <hi>Photinus</hi> lacked not. For he was a manne by witte able to doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as anye: in all kynde of
<pb facs="tcp:4883:54"/>knowledge excellent: for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and ſwete pronuntiation inferiour to none. Who copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weyghtely diſputed and wrote in bothe tongues, as is manifeſt by his bookes, whiche he made and penned as well in the Greke tongue as alſo the laten tongue. But happely the flocke of Chriſt committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, being very vigilant and warye, for and concernynge the catholicke faythe, remembred quickely the watche worde ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen tofore by Moyſes: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they wondred at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of theyr Prophet, and Paſtour: yet wer they well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptacion. For whom they afore folowed as the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weather of their flocke: nowe they auoyde and flie from hym
<pb facs="tcp:4883:54"/>as a rauenyng wolfe.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the example not of <hi>Photinus</hi> onelye,<note place="margin">Photinus.

Yea, he was ſo worthye a man, and of ſuche eſtimation, as in moſte thinges mought very quickely be credited. For who was more excellent in fineſſe of witte then he?

Howe manye hereſies in howe manye volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes he hath expreſſed, how ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye errours contrary and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to the fayth he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, I nede not declare.

It were a tedious buſines to recite all the workes that he made: wherein he ſhewed hym ſelfe to be ſo excellent a clerke, as might worthelye be thought equall to the chiefe builders of Chriſt his churche: had he not through prophane luſt of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall noueltie, ymagined that new fangled errour, wherwith as with the poiſon of a running Leprie, ſo defiled he the reſt of his doinges, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cefurth his doctrine was thought and accompted rather to be eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall temptation, then ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall edification.

               <hi>Photinus.</hi> Whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:4883:56"/>ſect is this.<note place="margin">Photinus.</note> He ſayeth <hi>that God is but a ſingle and ſolitarye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, and that he muſte be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after the maner of the Iewes. He denaieth the Trinitie and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to be no perſon either of the ſon or of the holy ghoſt. He affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Chriſt to be only ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that he toke his beginning of Marye.</hi> And this he teacheth veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, that we oughte to confeſſe the onelye perſonne of God the father, and wurſhyppe Chriſt as man onelye. This was the hereſie that <hi>Photinus</hi> mayntained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apollinaris</hi> braggeth, that in the vnitie of the Trinitie he doeth conſent with vs,<note place="margin">Apollinaris hereſie.</note> and yet the ſame he blaſphemeth with his erronious profeſſion touchynge the incarnation of Chriſt. For he ſayth, that <hi>in the fleſ he of our
<pb facs="tcp:4883:57"/>Sauiour, eyther the ſoule of man was not at all, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch one as lacked vnderſtanding and reaſon. Moreouer he ſay de that Chriſt receyued not fleſhe of the bleſſed virgin Mary, but that he came from heauen into the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi> And being wauerynge and doubtfull what he might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynlye at all tymes auowche, he ſome tymes affirmed, <hi>the fleſhe of Chriſte to be coeternall with God the worde, ſome times to be made of the diuinite of the worde.</hi> For he would neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe two ſubſtaunces to be in Chriſt, one diuine another hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: the one receiued of God his father, the other of Mary his mother. But he ſuppoſed that the nature of the worde was deuided: as though a part
<pb facs="tcp:4883:57"/>therof remained ſtill in God, &amp; a part alſo was turned into fleſh. Inſomuche that where as the veritie ſaith, one Chriſt to be of two natures, he being aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to trueth, affirmeth two ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaunces to be made of one diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Chriſte. And this was the error of <hi>Apollinaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neſtorius</hi> contrarie to <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris,</hi> whiles he feineth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte two natures in Chriſte, <hi>Sodainly doth introduce two per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo deuilliſhlye imagineth to be twoo Sonnes of God, twoo Chriſtes, the one God, the other man, the one begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the father, the other begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mother.</hi> And for this cauſe he affirmeth <hi>that holye Marye ought not to be called the mother of God, but the mother of Chriſt.</hi> For becauſe of
<pb facs="tcp:4883:58"/>her was borne, not that Chriſte which is god, but he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if any man thinke that in his bokes he writeth one Chriſt and preacheth one perſone of Chriſt, let him not lyghtly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit hym. For he doeth it vpon purpoſe to deceiue, that by good he may perſwade euil, as Thap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaieth. <hi>Per bonum mihi operatus eſt mortem,</hi> That is to ſay. <hi>By that which was good he hath wroght vnto me deathe.</hi> Vndoubtedlye this was his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Chriſt was borne veray man, and not yet ſociated in the vnitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vnto the word: but that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the perſon of the word deſcended into him. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt now be aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, &amp; ſitteth in the glorie of god, yet ſaith he, betwene him and other
<pb facs="tcp:4883:58"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was only, &amp; ſo now remaineth. Theſe be the blaſphemies that <hi>Neſtorius, Apollinaris,</hi> &amp; <hi>Photinus</hi> as mad dogges haue barked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the catholike faieth, taught and receiued in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Churche. Whiche truely and ſyncerely iudginge of God the father and our ſauiour the ſonne, blaſphemeth not, either in the myſterie of the trinitie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt. For ſhe honoreth bothe one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie in the fulneſſe of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, &amp; the equalitie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in one and the ſame maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. She alſo confeſſeth one Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, not two: &amp; the ſame one Chriſt, to be both God and man. Againe in that one Chriſt to be one perſon and twoo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
<pb facs="tcp:4883:59"/>or natures: two natures or ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, becauſe the word of God is not mutable, that it in parte or in all mighte be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into fleſhe, neyther twoo perſons but one perſon. Leaſt in profeſſinge twoo ſonnes, ſhe mighte ſeeme to worſhyppe a quaternitie and not a Trinitie. But it ſhalbe good to declare &amp; enucleate the ſame ſomewhat more expreſſelye and diſtinctly. Vnderſtande therfore, that in God is one only ſubſtaunce and three perſones: in Chriſte are two natures and one onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. In the Trinitie are mo per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons, but not mo natures: in our ſauiour mo natures but not mo perſons. Why ſo? Becauſe in the Trinite there is one perſon of the Father, another perſon
<pb facs="tcp:4883:59"/>of the Sonne, an other of the holye Ghoſt: and yet of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Sonne, &amp; of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, there is one only and the ſame nature and no mo. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo in oure ſauioure Chriſte there be mo natures, as one of the diuinitie, an other of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie: yet not two perſones. For the deitie is not one perſon, and the humanitie an other per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon: but bothe is one onely and the ſame Chriſte, one onely and the ſame ſonne of God. And of one onely and the ſame Chriſte, and the ſonne of God, one only and the ſame perſon is, and no mo. As in man the fleſhe is one thinge, and the ſoule an other thinge: yet is it but one and the ſame man, the fleſhe &amp; the ſoule.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:60"/>In Peter or Paule the ſoule is one thinge &amp; the fleſhe an other thinge: yet are there not twoo Peters the ſoule and the fleſhe, or the ſoule one Paule and the fleſhe and other Paule, but one and the ſame Peter, one &amp; the ſame Paule ſubſiſting of ii. ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry natures: the one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule, the other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. In lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner in one and the ſame Chriſte be two natures, but the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and the other humaine: the one of God the Father, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Marye virgine the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the one coequall &amp; coeterne vnto the father, thother tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and leſſe then the Father: thone conſubſtauntiall to the Father, thother conſubſtantial to the mother. Yet is but one
<pb facs="tcp:4883:60"/>and the ſame Chriſt in both ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaunces: &amp; not one Chriſt God, an other Chriſt man: not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create, an other create: not one impaſſible, an other paſſible: not one equall to the father, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſe then the Father: not one of the father, an other of the mother: but one onely and the ſame Chriſte is God and man: the ſame bothe create and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create, the ſame incommutable and impaſſible, the ſame was alſo commutable and paſſible, the ſame equall and inferior to the father: the ſame begotten of the Father before all worldes, the ſame borne in the worlde of his mother, perfite God &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite man: being God he is in ful diuinitie: being man he is in ful humanitie. Hauinge perfecte
<pb facs="tcp:4883:61"/>ſoule, and perfect fleſhe, perfect minde and perfecte vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge. There are in Chriſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word, ſoule, and fleſhe: but all thre one Chriſt, one ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, one ſauiour, one our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demer, one not in corruptible confuſion of the deitie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie together, but in a moſt perfect, miraculous &amp; ſingular vnitie of perſone. Neither doth that coniunction conuerte and chaung them one into an other, as the Arrians dreame: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Chriſt both natures are placed, that the ſingularitie of one and the ſame perſon ſtill remaininge in Chriſte, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie alſo of eche nature abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for euer, that at any tyme god neither beginneth to be the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:61"/>bodie, neither ceaſeth to be the body To the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereof, the iuſte conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mannes ſtate ſhall eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye induce vs. For we knowe that not in this preſent worlde onely, but alſo in the worlde to come, euery man ſhall conſiſt of bodye and ſoule. Yet ſhall not the bodye at anye time be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into the ſoule, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule into the bodye, but eche manne made to liue without ende: in man neceſſarelye the difference of bothe ſubſtaunces ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne without ende for euer.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo in Chriſt the propertie of bothe natures remayne for euer, and yet in one vnitie of perſonne. But wher as I name often times the perſonne, and ſaye that God the perſone is
<pb facs="tcp:4883:62"/>made man, it is to be feared, leaſt ſome miſtake vs to ſaye that GOD the worde hathe taken vpon him our nature and ſubſtaunce, by onelye imitaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the action: and that he was here conuerſaunt, not as man in dede, but as a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayte perſonne of man. As in ſtage playes we ſee, where one man reſembleth ſodaynlye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers perſonnes, and yet is he none of them all. For as ofte as we woulde expreſſe the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another mans trade or office, in doing therof we ſo vſe the diligence of other, that they not withſtandinge whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and repreſent, are not thoſe that are reſembled &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. As for example: when the ſtage Player playeth the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:62"/>Prieſt or King, it foloweth not that he is eyther prieſt or King. Therfore, for the acte or parte ceaſyng, the perſonne alſo cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, whiche he did vſurpe. God forbyd we Chriſtians ſhoulde vſe any ſuche abhominable and peſtilent mockerye in the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his ſonne Chriſt god and man. Let this madnes and fantaſie be left vnto the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheis</hi> the preachers of dreames.<note place="margin">Manicheis</note> The catholike fayth confeſſeth the worde of God ſo to be made man, that he receyueth truelye and manifeſtlye all that ours is, not deceyuably and coulera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye. And that he executeth all thynges that were humayne, not as thoughe he imitated a ſtraunge parte, but rather as properlye his owne, he verelye
<pb facs="tcp:4883:63"/>and truely being the ſelfe ſame whoſe perſonne he dyd repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. As we our ſelues alſo in that we ſpeake, we vnderſtand, we lyue, we be: we do not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imitate men, but we are men in dede. Neyther were Peter and Iohn (to name them chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye aboue all other) menne by imitation, but by being. In like ſort God the worde in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge and hauynge fleaſhe, in ſpeaking, doyng, and ſufferyng in the fleaſhe without corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not withſtanding his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, voucheſafed to do and per fourme all this, not to thende that he might imitate, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayte, or reſemble a perfecte ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but becauſe he was in dede and verelye ſubſiſted perfecte man. Therefore as the ſoule
<pb facs="tcp:4883:63"/>knit vnto the fleſhe, neyther yet tourned into the fleſhe, doth not imitate man, but is man: and man not by ſimulation, but by ſubſtaunce, ſo the worde God without any conuerſion of any parte of hym, in comminge and confoundyng him ſelfe to man, is made man, not by imitation but by ſubſiſtynge. He therfore that will be of God muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ineffable word of God, in the incarnation of his ſonne Chriſte, and acknowledge one and the ſame Chriſt to be vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and perfectlye God, verelye and perfectlye man in one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of one perſonne, whiche vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perſonne was compacte and perfected not after the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin was deliuered, but euen in the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be of the virgin. And we
<pb facs="tcp:4883:64"/>ought dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to be ware that we imagine not, Chriſte to be two, becauſe of his two natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: whom we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe to be one only, &amp; euer one. One in his conception, &amp; one after. One in his birth, &amp; one after. One in the time of his baptiſme, &amp; one euer after, Vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being but one, (and yet both God and man, by reaſon of that vnitie of perſon) both the properties of God are attributed to man, &amp; the proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of man aſcribed to God.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is written in the ſcriptures,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.</note> that the ſonne of man came downe from heauen, and the Lord of Maieſtie was crucified in earth. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of this vnitie of perſonne, the Churche ſayeth and bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth very catholikely, that God

Bleſſed (I ſaye) is the churche, whiche beleueth that in Chriſte be two true and perfect natures, and but one perſon, that neither the diuiſion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures diuideth the vnitie of hys perſon, nor the vnitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the difference of the natures. Bleſſed (I ſaye) is the Churche, whiche humbly confeſſeth, that Chriſte manne was not vnited to God after his natiuitie, but in the chaſte wombe of his mother: to thende ſhe might acknowledge hym to be nowe, and euer more to haue been. Bleſſed is the Churche, whiche vnderſtandeth God to be made man, not by conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, but by conſideration of perſon, and ſuch perſon as is

In reſpecte of that vnitie ſhe confeſſeth that man is the ſonne of God, &amp; God the ſonne of Marye the virgin. Thus muche of this matter: the weighte whereof requireth an exact treatiſe But in this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent
<pb facs="tcp:4883:67"/>place, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to touch by the waye brieflye, whiche by Goddes leaue I purpoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after moore plentuouſlye to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſſe at an other time. Nowe let vs procede as we beganne. I ſaied before and nowe I ſay againe, that in the Churche of God, the temptation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, is the error of the maiſter or teacher. And ſomuch greater is the temptation, the greater knowlege of him is that erreth. As we declared, firſt by thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ſcriptures, nexte by eccleſiaſticall examples, in the reherſal &amp; allegation of ſuch as at the beginninge were eſte med catholike in faieth, and ſound in doctrine: at length not withſtandynge either fell into ſome other ſect, or diuiſed ſome
<pb facs="tcp:4883:67"/>newe of their owne braines. Verely it is a great matter pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable to be knowen, verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be often recorded, &amp; worthye by dyuers examples continually to be illuſtrated, and dryuen into euery mannes harte: howe that all catholike men at all times, haue thought themſelues bounde to receiue the teachers within the church, and not forſake the faith of the Churche with the teachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in errour.</p>
            <p>But where as I am able to bryng furth many in thys kind of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting, yet I ſuppoſe none to be compared with <hi>Origenes</hi> teptacion,<note place="margin">Origenes.</note> in whom were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent, ſingular, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous giftes, that he was as it were a marke for euery man

For if the lyfe geueth any authoritie to man, no doubte he did leade a verye perfect, holy, and continent life, in much pacience, and ſuffering. Yf the ſtocke &amp; parentage: who more noble then he, which was ſprong of that honorable houſe, that firſte was bewtified with bleſſed Martyrdome? Who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde for Chriſte his ſake not onely forſakinge his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall father, but leauyng alſo all hys goodes and ſubſtaunce, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche proffeted amongeſt the harde ſtraightes of holy pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that many times and oft he was ſharpely handled, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ
<pb facs="tcp:4883:68"/>ſynge the name of oure Lorde. Adde therto, that ſo great was his knowledge in all kinde of literature, matched with ſuche finenes of wit, powdered with ſuch pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deliuerau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his wordes, that he was thoughte piereleſſe without felowe. The highe magnificence of whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolute knowledge was ſuche, that few or none were thought to approche. His pronunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vtteraunce ſo ſwete, that from his lyppes not wordes, but hony might haue ſemed to flowe. What matters ſeminge neuer ſo hard, hath not he with force of diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made ſmoth, &amp; cleere? What thinges ſeminge veray hard to be done, hath not he made to appeare eaſie by his owne example? But ſome wyll
<pb facs="tcp:4883:69"/>thinke that he perſwaded hys aſſertions by ſubteltie of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente onely. Yea there was not one of the Churche that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mo examples out of the holy ſcriptures, then he did in anye worke that he made, as he made veray many. And that no thing might be lacking in him that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde encreaſe his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or inlarge his eſtimation, he atteined the full perfection of age. And in his time he had ſo many diſciples, whom effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually bothe by continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of doctrine, and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall example of maners he had ſoo framed that of hym, and as it were out of his boſome iſſued innumerable Doctours, Miniſters, Confeſſours, and Martyrs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:4883:69"/>
            <p>Finally in howe great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, glorye, and fauour, he was with all men, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe? vnto whom diuers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye men from all partes ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whome the Chriſtians ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, as a Prophete. The Philoſophers reuerenced as a maiſter. Whome for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of his heauenly wiſdom, not onely men of priuate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo themperiall ſtate honoured. Recorde of hiſtories, whiche report that the mother of Alexander the Emperour, ſent for hym to learne at hys mouth heauenly wiſdom, wher of he had a ſpeciall grace, &amp; ſhe a burnyng deſire. The ſame hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories alſo reporte vnto vs the teſtimonye of an epiſtle, whiche he endicted with the maieſtie of
<pb facs="tcp:4883:70"/>chriſtian prelacie, and ſent it vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Philippe themperour,<note place="margin">Philippe.</note> who firſt was made chriſtian of the Romayne Princes. Touching the incredible knowledge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that epiſtle, yf any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not the chriſtian teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye at my reporte, at leaſt wiſe let him receyue the gentle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion vpon the teſtimonye of prophane Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>For that impious and wicked man <hi>Porphyrius</hi> doeth confeſſe,<note place="margin">Porphyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> that by the ſounde of his fame, he was ſtyred to trauel as far as Alexandria, being in maner yet but a boye: and that he there ſawe <hi>Origines,</hi> well ſtept in age: but ſuch one, of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, as who had buylded in him ſelfe a towre of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. No doubt he was a man
<pb facs="tcp:4883:70"/>ful of worthines. Al whos moſt worthye qualities I coulde not rehearſe in a daye: no not the leaſt part of them. And they all do pertayne not onelye vnto the glorye of religion, but alſo vnto the greatnes of the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who woulde eyther ſuſpect ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wit, ſo great knowledge, &amp; of ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull grace? Or woulde not rather vſe that ſentence, that I <hi>had leuer erre with Origent, hen to thinke trueth with other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What nedes many wordes? It came to this paſſe, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation of ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble a perſon, ſo great a mayſter, ſo hiegh a prophet, allured very many from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> integrite of their faythe. Wherfore the ſame <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> whileſt he more inſolentlye

He at length taketh vpon him to interpretate &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound certen partes of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures after a new guyſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath alſo deſerued, that of him it ſhoulde be ſayde: <hi>Si ſura rexerit in medio tui Propheta non audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as verba illius prophetae, quia tent at uos dominus deus uester, vtrum díligatís eum an non.</hi> That is to ſay: <hi>If there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſe amonge you a Prophet, thou ſhalte not heare the voyce of that Prophet, becauſe the Lorde your God tempteth you whether you
<pb facs="tcp:4883:71"/>loue him or not.</hi> Doubtleſſe it is not onelye a temptacion, but a very great temptacion, when he on whome the congregation of Chriſt doth wholly ſtai, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the churche leneth, allured by the admiration of his witte, knowledge, eloquence, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and grace (whiche were all wonderfull in him) doeth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynlye traduce the ſame (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fearinge or ſuſpectynge) from the auncient religion into newe prophanities. But ſome man wyll ſaye, that the bookes of <hi>Origen</hi> are corrupted. I doe not withſtande that. Yea, I would that <hi>Origens</hi> bokes wer corrupt rather then <hi>Origen</hi> him ſelfe. And that his bookes are corrupted, diuers aſwell of the catholykes, as heretikes haue
<pb facs="tcp:4883:72"/>firmed. How be it this it is that we ought now to attend, that if not <hi>Origen</hi> him ſelfe, yet the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes put furth in his name were a great temptacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terynge full of foule blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, were read and receyued for his, and not for anye other mans. In ſo muche that al be it in conceyuynge anye errour, it was not the minde of <hi>Origen:</hi> yet to the perſuaſion of errour, the authoritie of <hi>Origen</hi> maye ſeeme muche to preuayle.</p>
            <p>The like may be ſpoken of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertullian</note> a man no leſſe notable and famous amongeſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, then was <hi>Origen</hi> amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the Greekes. For what coulde be more excellent then this man? Who more exerciſed in the holy ſcriptures, and in all
<pb facs="tcp:4883:72"/>other humayne letters then he? Whoſe breſte was farced vp with a moſt plenteous varietie of all maner of knowledge.</p>
            <p>There was no ſect of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, no part of theyr ſtudies, whiche he had not ſought, and faithfully placed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſurye of remembraunce. He ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in grauitie and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of witte, that he hath not at anye time almoſte purpoſed to withſtande or ouerthrow anye controuerſie, which either by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of witte or by wayghte of argumentes he archiued not.</p>
            <p>The prayſe of whoſe oration who can expreſſe? Whiche was interlaſed wyth ſo greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of reaſon, that it did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and inforce to his opinion, ſuch as otherwyſe he could not
<pb facs="tcp:4883:73"/>induce and perſwade. In which almoſt howe manye wordes, ſo manye ſentences be. And howe many ſentences, ſo many victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. A great many can recorde this, and ſpeciallye <hi>Marciones, Apelles, Praxee, Hermogenes,</hi> the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable heretikes called <hi>Gnoſtici.</hi> Whoſe blaſphemies he hath in great &amp; large volumes defaced, and as it were with the violent ſtroke of percinge lightninge, clene ouerthrowen.

<pb facs="tcp:4883:74"/>the myſticall bodye of Chriſte, whiche eſtemeth no ſingular mans authoritie, witte, or iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, knowlege, or eloquence, aboue the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt: whiche preferreth not the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loue, or frendeſhip of anye ſingular perſon, before the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall and catholike faith. But deſpiſing all thoſe thinges, doth abide permanent, and ſtable in faith, and reſolueth with him ſelfe to receiue, hold, and beleue which he knoweth the catholike Churche vniuerſally and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to haue receiued, holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; beliued. And what euer new doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine at any time after, he ſhall perceiue to be brought in by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, either beſides, or aboue, or contrarie and repugnant to that whiche the catholike fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:4883:75"/>haue in conſente agreid vpon, he adiudgeth the ſame to pertaine, not to religion, but vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to temptation onely: accordinge to the holeſome doctrine of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed S.

And the chaffe is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with lightly pufte out, hauinge not the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of good corne to keepe it within the floore of the catholike vnitie. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee howe ſome take their leaue, &amp; ſhake handes for euer: ſome other hange houerynge in the ayre, and kepe them aloufe, both fearing to depart, and aſhamed to retourne, beynge wounded &amp; halfe dead, and half aliue.

<pb facs="tcp:4883:76"/>and medicine of Goddes mercie towardes them, if they be wiſe.

<pb facs="tcp:4883:82"/>or expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of ſcriptures, if the gift of God hath made the a fitte inſtrument thereunto in witte, doctrine, and exerciſe, bee thou <hi>Beſelehel</hi> the workeman of the ſpirituall tabernacle.

Adorne, decke &amp; ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> furth wiſely. Adde with the vttermoſt of thy power ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, grace, &amp; bewtie. Through the, and thyne expoſitions, let it be perceiued more clearelye, whiche before was darke, and yet beleued faithfully. Through the and thy frauel, let the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie reioyce in the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of that, whiche tofore the antiquitie did worſhip, and not vnderſtande. But yet teach the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:82"/>ſame thinges, whiche thou haſt learned, and none other: that, when thou ſpeakeſt newely, yet thou ſpeake not newe matters. Here ſome wil ſaye. What, ſhal there be no increaſe had of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the churche of Chriſte-Yes, what els? Who is ſo iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bothe to God and man, that would not ſo? But increaſe I would ſhould be, &amp; not decreaſe: a confirmation, not alteration: renouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not innoua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion. For ech thing receiueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, &amp; is properly increaſed, which is amplified &amp; enlarged, in it ſelfe remayning one thinge notwithſtanding, and the ſame ſtill. But vnto permutation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, or innouation it belon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth that ſomethinge in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce be altered &amp; conuerted
<pb facs="tcp:4883:83"/>from one into an other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gladlie admit and allow the increaſe of religion, that is: I will and I thinke meete that the churche do increaſe, growe, and proſpere in all ages and at all times, verie muche in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vnderſtanding and wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But in one onely kynde, ſenſe, and vnderſtandinge. Let the religion of ſoules imitate the conſideration of the bodies. For although the bodyes in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe of yeres are inlarged in their membres, yet doe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine the ſame bodies, that thei were. There is much difference betwene the flower of youthe, and the ripenes of age. Yet be they made, olde, whiche were before young. That, all if of one and the ſame man the ſtature
<pb facs="tcp:4883:83"/>and habit dothe alter and varie as time tunneth, yet the ſame nature, ſubſtaunce, and perſon is ſtil. Tender and ſmale are the membres of younge infantes: ſtronge and greate are the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men. Yet al one in euerie of them, &amp; as many. The infante hathe as many partes, as hath the man. And if there be any thinge that ſhoweth not it ſelfe, but in the ripe time of age: the ſame notwithſtanding was in the conſideration or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of the ſede, ſo that no newe thinge afterward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being ſtept in yeres, whiche fofore was not hidden in him being but a childe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no doubte but thys is the laweful and right rule of proffeting: this is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
<pb facs="tcp:4883:84"/>and goodlieſt ordre of gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing and increaſing, if the num bre of yeres, the courſe of age, the proceſſe of time, do reſemble and alwayes ſhowe the ſame partes, and formes in the aged. which the wiſedome of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour had tofore formed in them being litle ones. Nowe if the ſhape or forme of man, be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde turned and altered into any other figure vnlyke it ſelfe: or if the iuſt numbre of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and membres be either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, or increaſed, then of neceſſitie the bodie muſt either periſhe, or become mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruous, or at leeſt wiſe be greatly weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Euen ſo ſitting and meete it is, that the Chriſtian riligion be increaſed, and dilated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lyke ordre &amp; maner.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:84"/>That is to wit: religion oughte to be ſtrengthened in yeres, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in times, auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in age: but ſoo, that it remaine euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more one, and the ſame, vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, vnaltered in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all her partes: and as it were in all her propre mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, ſenſes, and qualities, full, ſounde and perfitte: neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any permutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſubſtaunce, ne ſuffering any da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the proprieties, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing any varietie in the ſette diffinitions, ſentences, or cenſures. As for example. Our forefathers haue ſowen in thys eccleſiaſticall agricolation, the cleane ſeede of whetie faieth. It were ſurely very vnſitting, and vniuſte, if we theire poſteritie ſhoulde chuſe cockle for whete,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:85"/>and admit the counterfeit and deceitefull error of the one, for the germaine and naturall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the other. Rather righte and conſequent it is, to thende no diſcrepance or contrarietie be founde betwene the firſt and the laſt, that of the encreaſe of whetie inſtitution, we reape the croppe of whety doctrine. That when anye parte of theſe good ſeedes ſowen by oure aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, ſhall by acceſſe of tyme ſpringe and blade vp, the ſame by vs bee cheriſhed, maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and defended vnto the moſt deſired harueſt: not altring or chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging any parte thereof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in qualitie or in ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: although we adde bewtie, fame &amp; diſtictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therto. For god defed, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roſy pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of their catho
<pb facs="tcp:4883:85"/>lyke determination, ſhoulde be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted into branbles &amp; thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. God defend that in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Paradiſe of the pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t graftes of Cyunamome, viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous raye or darnel ſhuld ſpring: of the wholſome ſlyppes of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamum, pernitious wolbane ſhould iſſue. Whatſoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith full laborours in thys Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation &amp; huſbandrie of Chriſt hys churche, haue ſowed and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, mete it is that the ſame by vs thyr children and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours be diligentlye and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye tylled, garniſhed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: that the ſame doe proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, increaſe and augment: the ſame doe ſtyll floure, and ſede, and atteyne to perfect ripenes. For decent and fitte it is, that
<pb facs="tcp:4883:86"/>the auncient preceptes, rules, and leſſons, concernynge the chriſtian religion, in proceſſe of time be fyned, poliſhed, and confirmed. But a curſſed and a deſtetable dede it is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truncate, mangle, or violate them, or anye parte of them. It is lawefull that throughe our diligence, induſtrie, and labour, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe receyue euidencie, light, diſtinction. But it is alſo neceſſary, that they ſtyl retaine their auncient fulneſſe, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, and proprietie. For yf this licentious libertie of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fraude, ſhalbe permitted to alter and chaunge the auncient cenſures of the vniuerſal chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: I am afrayde to ſaye, how great daunger ſhoulde enſue of
<pb facs="tcp:4883:86"/>breaking and aboliſhyng the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable concorde of Chriſt hys vniforme religion, within ſhort tyme. For anye one parte of the catholike inſtitution, beynge once broken and abdicate, the Lepriſie wil ſo crepe from part to parte, that at length the whole wyll be the leaſt parte, and vtterlye refuſed. Agayne if they beginne to myngie newe tryckes, with olde and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lawes: ſtraunge &amp; forayne deuiſes, with accuſtomed and familiar preceptes: prophane fantaſies, with ſacred and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ceremonies: no doubt it will grow to ſuche a cuſtome in the whole, that euer after it wyll be the practiſe of euerye lyght brayne, to alter and put downe olde religion, and to ſet vp new
<pb facs="tcp:4883:87"/>fangled toyes, deuiſed by theyr owne witte. In ſo muche that nothing ſhalbe left in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vnſpotted, vntouched, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled: but where the churche heretofore hathe been eſtemed and accompted the precious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of chaſte and vncorrupte veritie: from hencefurth it may be rekened the ſincke of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and foule errours. But God of hys mefureles mercye forbyd any ſuche deteſtable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe to entre into the myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of hys people. But let it be, as it hath been alwayes, and ſtil is, the furious and peuiſh prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the wicked, impious, and curſed. Let the church of Chriſt euermore be as it hathe been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ſhalbe for euer, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, warye, and faythfull ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="tcp:4883:87"/>of ſuche determinations, decrees, and ordinaunces as haue been lefte by our aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and vniuerſallye recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in conſent and vnitie. This true and faythfull churche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth nothinge, diminiſheth nothyng, addeth nothynge, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not away neceſſaries, and ſupplieth ſuperfluities: omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not her own, and vſurpeth that whiche pertayneth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. But with all diligence ſtudieth to preſerue, maintayne and continewe ſuche doctrine, as hathe deſcended vnto her from the auncient fathers by general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. And what hath been lefte vnto her only begon, and not ſettled: the ſame ſhe endeuoreth to publiſhe, fine, &amp; ſtabliſhe. What hath ben fully
<pb facs="tcp:4883:88"/>expreſſed, and throughly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: the ſame to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolidate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and aſſure. What hathe been confirmed, and ratified: the ſame faythfullye to kepe, folowe, and beleue. For what hath the churche purpoſed at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye time, by the decrees of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral counſailles, but that ſuch thynges ſhoulde afterwarde more diligentlye be obſerued, whiche afore were ſimply bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? And that, whiche tofore was but ſlackly taught, ſhould afterwarde be preached more in ſtantlye? This I ſay at al ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes and nothing els, the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che being vexed with the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nouelties of wicked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, hathe purpoſed to doe in the decrees of her counſeylles, that ſuche doctrine as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

What doctrine? The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholycke and vniuerſall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which hath remained one and the ſame by all ſucceſſion of ages, through incorrupt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of verite, &amp; ſhall remayne to the worldes end, whoſoeuer ſaye naye. What then? Doe not receyue him, ſayeth S. Paule, into thy houſe, neither ſhalte thou ſaye vnto hym, <hi>aue</hi> God ſpede. For he that ſayeth vnto him, God ſpede, or all hayle, he doeth communicate with hys wickednes. He ſayth prophane nonelties of wordes.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:89"/>What is prophane? Verely that whiche is neither God! ye nor goodly: all whory, and nothing holy: that whiche ſtraieth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the borders and boundes of the catholyke Churche, whiche is the temple of God. He ſaith, <hi>Prophane nouelties of wordes or voices.</hi> What is that? No doubt nouelties of wordes, opinions, cenſures, ſectes, contrarie to antiquitie, repugnaunte to the auncient faieth of the vniuerſal churche.

            <p>Who euer before <hi>Symon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> (of whome that olde goulfe of filthes euen vnto <hi>Priſcillianus</hi> by continuall and priuie ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion haue iſſued) durſie ſaye God our creatour to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of euell: that is, of oure wicked, impious, &amp; abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dedes? For he affirmeth that God hath created ſuch a nature in man, that by a certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre motion and impulſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſarie wyll, he neither can ne wil any thinge els, but ſinne: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:4883:91"/>exagitate, &amp; in flamed with the furies of al vices, he is pluct and pulled throughe inſatiable deſyre, into al kinde of iniquitie. There be inumerable examples of this ſorte, whiche I omit for breuities ſake: by whiche it is clerely and manifeſtly declared, that this hath been, as it were, a ſolemne vowe euer moore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges heretikes, to ſet vp pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phane nouelties, &amp; to neglecte the orders of auncietie. And by oppoſitions of doctrine falſelye termed, to haſarde the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke faith. Of thother ſide, this euermore hathe ben the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the catholikes, to kepe, maintaine, &amp; ſaue all ſuche god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders and conſtitutions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered and left of the holye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; to condempne vtterly
<pb facs="tcp:4883:92"/>all prophane nouelties accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſel of S. Paul. Who earneſtly warneth, if any ſhal preache vnto you any other doctrine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye haue receiued, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curſe him. Here perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſome wyll ſaye vnto me: do not ſuche as ye call heretikes vſe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures? And can the ſcriptures lye? Surely the ſcriptures lye not. Yet lyinge heretikes abuſe the teſtimony of the ſcriptures, yea and veray vehementlie. For ye ſhall ſe them flye throughe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie volume and parte therof, throughe all the bokes of Moy ſes, of the kynges, throughe all the Pſalmes, the Apoſtles, goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles, and Prophetes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, and with whomſoeuer they talke, beinge at home or a brode: whether they preache, or
<pb facs="tcp:4883:92"/>write: be they at feaſt, or in the ſtretes, ſcripture droppeth out of their mouthes as thicke as hayle from heauen. They bring not one iote of their owne, but the ſame is ſhadowed with ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture termes. Reade who liſt the workes of <hi>Paulus, Samoſatenus, or Priſcillianus, Eunomius, Iouini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> &amp; all other heretikes, that euer haue ben, or hereafter ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be. And ye ſhall finde an infinite heape of examples: yea ye ſhall ſe not one leafe in all their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes almooſt, but it is painted &amp; ſet as thicke with quotations &amp; notes in the margente, of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as well of tholde as the newe teſtamente, as poſſybly the margente canne holde.</p>
            <p>Yet are they deteſtable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. Of whome we oughte
<pb facs="tcp:4883:93"/>ſo muche the more to beware, and feare: the more priuely they lurk vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bowers of diuine ſcriptures. For they know well, that their trecherie, and filthes &amp; ill ſtenches, coulde not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſe, if they were nakedlye and ſimply brethed furth. And therefore they all beſprincle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſwet ſpices, as it were, of the heauenlye doctrine, that he whiche coulde quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende the humaine errour, myghte not yet ſodeinlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempne the diuine teſtimonies. And therefore they practiſe, as they dooe, whiche wyllynge too gyue vnto chyldren ſome bytter drynke, dooe fyrſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynte the lippe or brimme of the cuppe with hony or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſaunt thinge, that the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:93"/>ſimple and vnwarie age ſhould not feare the bitternes, hauing afore taſted the ſwetenes.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo doe theſe Heretikes, whiche doe colour and paynte before hand their euil ſedes and peſtilent ſyruppes with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and titles of ſingular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: to the ende that none ſhoulde ſuſpecte poyſon, when he hath readde afore wrytren remedye or medicine. Of theſe heretikes our Sauiour war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs to take hede. <hi>Attendite á falſis prophetis. <hi>Beware from falſe Prophetes, which come vnto you in ſhepes clothynge, but within they be rauenyng wolues.</hi>
               </hi> What is ment by ſhepes apparell or clothinge, but the ſentences of the Prophetes and Apoſtles?</p>
            <p>Who be the rauenyng wolues,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:94"/>but madde and furious hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, whiche alwayes vexe and inuade the foldes of the church, and to the vttermoſte of their might, rent and deuour the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent flocke of Chriſt? But to the ende they maye more craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telye ſtele vpon the vnwarye ſhepe, they putte of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and veſture of wolues, and ſhroude them ſelues all in phraſes and ſentences of the ſcriptures, as with flices of wolle: inwardlye notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding they continewe moſt cruel and rauening wolues. They do thus, that the ſimple ſheepe might not feare the cruell dent of their bloudie teethe, when they ſhal afore feele and ſee the ſoft &amp; wollye flice. But what ſayeth our Sauiour. <hi>Exfructibus
<pb facs="tcp:4883:94"/>corum cognoſcetis eos. <hi>Ye ſhall knowe them by their workes.</hi>
               </hi> That is: when they beginne to expound and interpretate the ſentences and textes of holye ſcripture, whiche tofore they broughte: then that bitterneſſe, that fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtenche ſauoreth: then that rauening woddenes is felt: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that new poiſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> droppeth furth: then doe theſe prophane nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues: then mayſt thou ſee the hedge broken, the boundes and limites of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ouerrun, then mayſt thou ſee the catholike faythe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and cutte, the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrine rent and torne.</p>
            <p>Theſe be they whiche the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paule ſpeaketh of in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Corinthians ſaying. <hi>Nam eiuſmodi Pſeudoapoſtoli operarij ſuh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doli
<pb facs="tcp:4883:95"/>tranſfigurant ſe in apostolos Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti. <hi>For ſuche falſe Apoſtles</hi>
               </hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth S. Paule) <hi>ſubtel and craftye workers, doe tranſſigure them ſelues into the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</hi> What dyd S. Paule meane thereby? Nothinges els, but as the. Apoſtles of Chriſte dyd bring furthe the teſtimonies of holye ſcripture, euen ſo do theſe falſe Apoſtles. And as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged the authorities of the Pſalmes, the ſame doe theſe allege: as they vſed the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Prophetes, ſo doe theſe falſe Apoſtles. There is no part of Gods ſcripture, but theſe falſe Apoſtles doe allege and brynge furthe, euen as the true Apoſtles of Chriſt dyd.</p>
            <p>And in thys ſorte they tranſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure them ſelues into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb facs="tcp:4883:95"/>of Chriſt. But when they come vnto the diuers and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like expoſitions of theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whiche they alyke brynge furth and allege, then is it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt whiche be the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and whiche be the falſe Apoſtles. Then doeth it appere who be the ſimple, and who be the craftye: who be the godlye, and who be the wycked. Then are the true Prophetes diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the falſe Prophetes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And no meruayle</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>for the Deuyll him ſelfe doeth tranſforme him ſelfe into an angell of light.</hi> No great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it then, yf hys miniſters be tranſfourmed lyke the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of ryghteouſnes.</p>
            <p>Therefore accordynge to S. Paule hys doctrine, as often as
<pb facs="tcp:4883:96"/>eyther falſe Apoſtles, or falſe Prophetes, or falſe teachers do brynge the ſentences of diuine lawe, therewith falſelye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded, to mayntayne theyr errors: there is no doubte but that they folow the craftye and ſubtil wayes of their head Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. For he knoweth that there is no way to that. As when he would ſtabliſh an errour, to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent the ſame wyth thauthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of holye Scripture. O, but ſome wyl ſaye. Howe canne ye proue, that the Deuyll is wont to vſe the teſtimonies of holye ſcriptures? It is proued ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlye to hym that readeth the Ghoſpell, where it is wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>Then the Deuyll toke our Lorde, our Sauiour, and ſette hym vpon the pinnacle of the temple,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:96"/>and ſayde vnto hym. If thou be the ſonne of God, caſte thy ſelfe downe from thys pinnacle. For it is written: that he hathe geuen in commaundement to his Angelles of the, that they kepe thee in all thy wayes: they ſhall beare the vp in their handes, that thy foote tryppe not at anye ſtone.</hi> What woulde he ſtycke to doe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelye poore creatures, that thus aſſaulted the Creatour hym ſelfe, the Lorde of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, with the teſtimonies of the ſcripture? <hi>If thou be the ſonne of God</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>tumble thy ſelfe downe, for it is written. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ſurelye the doctrine of thys place is diligentlye to be noted and be marked of vs, which let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to vnderſtande, that as often as we ſhall ſee anye to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb facs="tcp:4883:97"/>and produce the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the ſcriptures agaynſte the fayth and religion beleued and receyued in the vniuerſall Churche, that then we neede not doubt, but that the Deuyll by them worketh his olde feite. For as the head ſpake to the head, ſo nowe the membres ſpeake vnto the membres: that is, the membres of the Deuyll, to the membres of GOD, the wycked to the godlye, the falſe periured to the faythfull, the heretikes to the catholike. But what ſayeth the Deuyll? <hi>If thou be the ſonne of GOD, tumble thy ſelfe downe.</hi> That is to ſay. Wilt thou be the chylde of God? Wylte thou poſſeſſe the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of the kyngdome of god? Then tumble thy ſelfe downe.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:97"/>that is, diſpatche the from the tradition and doctrine of thys hyghe ſet churche: tumble thy ſelfe headlong downe from the pinnacle of the vniuerſall faith. And if ye aſke any of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes thus perſwadinge, howe he proueth, by what authoritie he teacheth, that ye oughte to tumble your ſelues from the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall and auncient faieth of the catholike Churche, <hi>ſcriptum eſt enim, <hi>for it is writen,</hi>
               </hi> ſaith he, and by &amp; by ye ſhal heare him power out a thowſande teſtimonies, examples, &amp; authorities embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeled out of the lawe, pſalmes, Apoſtles and Prophetes, by whiche authorities after a new and wicked maner expounded, the ſely ſoule is tumbled head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe from the towre of catho
<pb facs="tcp:4883:98"/>like trueth, downe into the dun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geon of blaſphemous hereſie. And hereto all heretikes adde wonderfull promiſes, whereby they intrap the ſimple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary after a merueious faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For they dare promiſſe and teache, that in theire Churche, that is, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticle of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, a great and ſpeciall, yea plainely, a certaine parciall grace of God is: in ſomuch that as manye as be of their congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gation, do flowe with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and are plentuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided for, by the onely diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of God, although they ſeke not, knocke not, and aſke not for it. And that they be borne vp by the Angelles of heauen that theire foote ones ſtumble not againſte any ſtone: that is
<pb facs="tcp:4883:98"/>to ſay, that they cannot offende or go amiſſe though they wold. But ſome wyll ſaye, if the teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies, ſentences, &amp; promiſes of the ſcripture are vſed of the deuill &amp; his miniſters, of whom ſome be falſe Prophetes, ſome falſe Apoſtles, ſome be falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers, and they all heretikes: what then ſhall the catholike men &amp; the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our mother the Church doe? By what mean ſhall they diſcerne the veritie in the holye ſcriptures, from the falſhood of ſuche heretikes? No doubte they muſt doe, as at the beginning I admoniſhed. They muſt doe as other godlye &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue done before them, and as they haue taughte vs to doe that followe them. What is that? They muſt interpretate,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:99"/>vnderſtande and expounde the ſcriptures of God accordynge to the traditions orders &amp; rules of the catholike Church: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they muſt alſo neceſſarilye ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerue &amp; followe the vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, antiquitie, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the catholike &amp; apoſtolike churche. And when ſo euer a parte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vniuerſalitie, nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſte auncientie, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention of a fewe ſhall rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the vniuerſall conſente of all or the moſt parte of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans: then preferre and eſteme the integritie of the vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, before the corruption of a parte. And in the ſame vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie, the religion of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, before the prophane nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: againe in that antiquitie, before the temeritie of one or a
<pb facs="tcp:4883:99"/>fewe, preferre chieflye the gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall decrees of an vniuerſall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell: and if none ſuche bee, then followe the conſent and cenſure of ſuche as haue tofore taughte and ruled in the churche of god. Whiche if we diligently, ſoberly and faiethfully obſerue, it ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be eaſy inoughe for vs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne or deprehende from tyme to time all peſtilent errors, of al ſortes of heretikes. Here nowe conſequent it is, that I by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, doe demonſtrate howe and in what wiſe, the prophane nouelties of heretikes maye be bothe deprehended and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dempned by the cenſures and ſentences of the aunciente fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, concordinge and agreing together. How be it we oughte to inueſtigate and followe the
<pb facs="tcp:4883:100"/>aunciente conſente of the holye fathers, not in euery ſmall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the ſcriptures, but only and chiefely in the rule of faith: neither at all times all kinde of hereſies are this wayes to bee impugned, but only newe and freſhe hereſies, as ſone as they put vp their heades. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue falſyfied the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidences of the auncient faieth, they maye be put of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by the ſtraightnes of the time, and before they may haue leaſure to goo about to corrupt and viciate the workes of oure elders with theire venime cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping moore at large. But olde and inueterate hereſyes cannot be ouerthrowen after this ſort, becauſe in longe tracte of times they haue gotten better occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4883:100"/>to incroche vpon trueth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuche olde hereſies muſt be euer conuinced by the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ſcripture, or els auoided, and deteſted, beinge al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>redy tofore conuinced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned by vniuerſall counſell of the catholike writers. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſone as any newe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane error beginneth to pepe vp, and the authour therof im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeleth for the defenſe of the ſame certain ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces out of the ſcripture, whiche he falſely and craftely dothe expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, by &amp; by muſt ye gather together y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition of the fathers vpon thoſe places, whiche were produced for the defenſe of the erroure.

Paule. <hi>He is not God of diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of peace.</hi> That is to ſaye, he is not the God of hym which ſhrinketh from the vnite of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent, but of ſuche as abyde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt in the peace of conſent with other <hi>As I teach you</hi> (ſayth
<pb facs="tcp:4883:103"/>he) <hi>in al congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.</hi> That is, of the Catholike, which therefore are called ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, becauſe they perſiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaunte in the communion of fayth. And yf any one would ſo muche arrogate vnto him ſelfe, as thoughe he onelye were to be hearde, and credited before all other, S. Paule to hys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profe ſayeth thus: <hi>Came the worde of God from you, or came it into you onely?</hi> But leaſt this ſhoulde ſeeme to be ſpoken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſmale conſideration, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further. <hi>If any man ſemeth to be a Prophete or ſpirituall, let him knowe thoſe thinges which I do write vnto you: becauſe they are the commaundementes of the Lorde.</hi> Whiche commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, he that is counted a
<pb facs="tcp:4883:103"/>Prophet or ſpirituall, that is to ſaye: a maiſter of ſpirituall matters, doth not with earneſt ſtudye of equalitie and vnitie obſerue: that eyther preferreth his owne opinion before others or in any poynt goeth from the iudgement of the vniuerſall conſent. <hi>The commaundement hereof who knoweth not</hi> (ſayeth S. Paule) <hi>ſhall not be knowen.</hi> That is to ſaye: whoſoeuer ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth not learne whyche he knoweth not, or beyng kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen doeth contemne: the ſame man ſhal not be knowen. That is, he ſhalbe counted vnworthy on whome amongeſt other vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in fay the and knitte in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian humilitie, the heauenlye mercye maye be extended. And what thynge worſſe? What e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll
<pb facs="tcp:4883:104"/>more bytter canne be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed then thys? And yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to thys Apoſtolycke commination we ſee the ſame hathe chaunced vnto <hi>Iulian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian,</hi> who eyther neglected to incorporate hym ſelfe to the mynde and ſentence of other fathers, or preſumed to excor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate hym ſelfe, that tofore was one of them.</p>
            <p>But nowe time it is, that accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge to my promiſe, I declare by example when and how the ſentences of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy fathers may be gathered together, that by them the rule of Eccleſiaſticall faythe myghte be aſſured and confirmed, accordynge as by decree and authoritie of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle is ſette furthe.</p>
            <p>And to doe thys, fytte and
<pb facs="tcp:4883:104"/>neceſſarye it is, that I doe eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones reuoke, what tofore was ſayde. I ſayde at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge, that thys euermore was, and ſtyl is the cuſtome of Catholike and true beleuers, to approue the true faythe by two wayes. Firſt by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of diuine Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondlye by tradition of the catholyke Churche. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſufficeth not, or plentuouſly contayneth not all thinges neceſſarye: but becauſe euery man expounding the ſame accordynge to theyr owne fantaſies, do often times conceyue dyuers errours, and ſtraunge opinions, centrary to the intent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcriptures. And therefore it is neceſſarye that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intelligence &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
<pb facs="tcp:4883:105"/>of the heaueuly ſcripture, be directed according to one v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niforme rule of the eccleſiaſtical iudgement, eſpeciallye in thoſe queſtions on whiche the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion of the whole catholike doctrine doeth ſtaye. We ſayde moreouer, that we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider in the churche the conſent aſwel of the vniuerſalitie as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of antiquitie. Leaſt we be bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken of from the integritie of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, into ſome prophane error: or leaſt we be tumbled from the religion of auncientie headlong into nouelties of vnknowen he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. I haue ſayde alſo, that in the ſame antiquitie of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we ought vehementlye and ſtudiouſly to obſerue two thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vnto which eche man muſt cleue faſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will not be an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike.
<pb facs="tcp:4883:105"/>The firſt is, if any thinge in the antiquitie of the churche hathe been decreed by all catholike teachers and holy fathers, and hathe been ſetfurth by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vniuerſall counſell. Next, if there hap to ariſe any newe queſtion, whiche is not decided by generall counſell, that then euery good man ought to haue recourſe vnto the auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ſtedfaſtly perſeuered in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the catholike communion and faieth. And whatſoeuer they in one minde and conſente haue receyued and taught, the ſame we ought to iudge and ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept, as mooſt ſyncere, pure, and catholike doctrine. And that this myght not ſeeme to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rather of my owne head,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:106"/>then by authoritie eccleſiaſtical, I haue drawen to example the godly counſell kepte in <hi>Afia</hi> at <hi>Epheſus, Baſſus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> two noble perſones then beinge conſulles. In which counſell, a motion beinge made for orders and rules to be deuiſed for the ſtabliſhinge of the faieth, it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto all the fathers there aſſembled, whiche were aboute C C. in numbre, a thinge ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye catholike, right faiethfull, and moſte beeſt to be done, leſt any prophane noueltie ſhoulde by chaunce crepe in, contrarye to their godly purpoſe, as to fore in the counſell kepte at <hi>Arimine</hi> in Italy, to bringe furthe the ſentences, cenſures, &amp; opinions of the holye fathers, of whiche ſome were Martyrs, ſome wer
<pb facs="tcp:4883:106"/>Confeſſors: and al were &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly remained catholike prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, true &amp; faiethful teachers. And according to their minde, conſente, and decree well and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoutly conſidered, the religion of chriſtian faieth might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and the blaſphemie of prophan noueltie condempned. This thus done, of righte that wicked <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was condemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned as an heretike, iniurious to the catholike auncientye, and bleſſed <hi>Cyrillus</hi> was pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced catholike, conſenting and agrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble vnto the holye antiquitie. And for the better warrant of the matter, I learned the names of the ſame fathers, although I haue forgotten their order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to whoſe cenſure and iudgement, both ſuche ſentences
<pb facs="tcp:4883:107"/>as then were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerted, were expounded, and alſo the rule of the diuine doctrine ſtabliſhed. Whiche fathers here to reherſe by name, I thinke it not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. For thereby ſhal my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie be confirmed. Wherefore theſe were they, whoſe wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges are recited, beinge either iudges, or witneſſes in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell. S. <hi>Peter</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> a verie excellente teacher, &amp; mooſte bleſſed Martyr. Holy <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> highe prelate of the ſame citie, a right faithful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and mooſt worthie confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. Holy <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Byſhoppe alſo of the ſame citie, a man for his faieth, lyfe, and knowledge very famous. Whom ſucceded <hi>Cyrill,</hi> a father of muche reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. To theſe holy fathers and
<pb facs="tcp:4883:107"/>godlye Byſhoppes of our Citie and prouince adde thoſe ſhining beames of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> as ſaint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> Byſhoppe and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of <hi>Nazianſe.</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> Byſhop &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſor of <hi>Caeſarea, Cappadocia</hi> &amp; other. S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> alſo byſhop of <hi>Nice,</hi> a man for his faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, integritie, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome moſt worthie to be, as he was, brother to holye <hi>Baſill.</hi> All theſe were Greekes. Amongeſt the Latines alſo were manye, that by their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t allowed the matters paſſed in that coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſel: as S. <hi>Felix</hi> martyr, and S. <hi>Iulie</hi> Byſhoppes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lykewiſe bleſſed S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. Holye ſainte <hi>Ambroſe</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Mediolanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Theſe were they, whiche were in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
<pb facs="tcp:4883:108"/>of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as iudges, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Maiſters, and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: whoſe doctrine that bleſſed Synode faiethfullye imbraced: and folowinge theire counſell, beleuinge their teſtimonie, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge their iudgement, haue ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, truely, and faiethfullye pronounced of matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faieth. Theſe fathers were but tenne in numbre. A greater numbre mought haue been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereto, but there was noo neceſſitie: becauſe as the tyme ſerued, the matters conſiſted not in the multitude of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and noman doubted, but all other catholike men thoughte and beleued as theſe tenne did. After all theſe thinges, I alſo added S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> his ſentence. Whiche is conteined in the eccle
<pb facs="tcp:4883:108"/>ſiaſticall geſtes. For what tyme the Epiſtle of holye <hi>Capreolus,</hi> Byſhoppe of <hi>Carthage</hi> was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, who intended and deſired nothinge els, but that the holye antiquitie mought be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and wicked noueltie anulled, and vtterlye refuſed, then S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> pronounced &amp; defined in fourme as followeth. <hi>And this Epiſtle</hi> (ſaied he) <hi>of the reuerend and moſt godly father Capreolus Biſſhop of Carthage, ſhalbe rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the boke of our geſtes and decrees, concerninge the faieth, whoſe ſentence is ſo playne. For he will that the ſentences, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the auncient faieth be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed, and ſtabliſhed: and that newe founde fanſies and inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be reproued and conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pned, as bothe ſuperfluous and wicked.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4883:109"/>Hereto all the Byſhoppes gaue their conſent, al wholly agreed therupon, all together with one voyce wiſhed the ſame. Wherto gaue they their conſent? What was it, that they in one voyce together wiſhed? Verely, that ſuche doctrine, as was of olde taught and receyued, ſhoulde be euermore allowed and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and what of late dayes was newely deuiſed, ſhould for euer be refuſed. After whiche thinges, I was for my parte brought into a very greate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of their doinges, and coulde not ſufficientlye, as me thought, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the wonderful humilitie and godly deuotion of ſo great clerkes and holy men. For although they were ſuche and ſo many, indued with ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:4883:109"/>excellent knowledge, with ſuch ineſtimable iudgement, that eche and euery of them mought haue frelye queſtioned in anye matter of the auncient faythe: and againe, theyr aſſembly and congregation together mighte ſeeme to incourage, and imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the ſame newe matters of theyr owne heades deuiſed to decree and ſet furthe: yet would they innouate nothinge: but by al maner meanes cared, that no doctrine ſhould be deliuered vn to theyr poſteritie, but ſuch as they had receyued of the forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thus dyd theſe fathers not onelye for the good diſoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thynges at that preſent tune, but alſo to leaue example to ſuche as ſhould folow them, what they ſhoulde doe in lyke
<pb facs="tcp:4883:110"/>caſe. That they ought with all their ſtudie to honour the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient faith, and not deuiſe new: to mayntayne ſuche religion, as they had receyued, and not to ſet furth what of their owne braynes was deuiſed.</p>
            <p>I inueighed alſo agayuſt the moſt wicked and peſtilent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of deuilliſhe <hi>Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who bragged of hym ſelfe, that he firſt and onelye of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderſtode the ſcriptures rightlye, and that all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time wandred in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and errour, as many as ener had taught or written vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcriptures: as all Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, Biſhoppes, Matyrs Eon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, that eyther haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the ſcriptures, or geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> credit to others expoſitions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:4883:110"/>the ſame. And who finallye affirmed, the whole church euen nowe to be in blindnes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and euer to haue been, whiche nowe folowed, and at all tymes had folowed, as it ſeemed vnto hym ignoraunt, blinde, and erronious doctours and teachers. And although to haue ſayde thus muche, might ſeeme ſufficient to ouerthrowe and vtterlye to deface all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane nouelties, yet for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter furniſhynge vp of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue adiected two autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rities of the Apoſtolike See.</p>
            <p>The one of <hi>Xiſtus</hi> Byſhoppe of Rome. The other of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour <hi>S. Celeſtine,</hi> whiche here I ſhall recount. Holye <hi>Xiſtus</hi> in the epiſtle whiche he wrote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Byſhoppe of Antioche,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:111"/>concernynge <hi>Neſtorius</hi> matter, ſayeth thus. <hi>For aſmuche as ther is but one fayth accordynge to the Apoſtle, whiche nowe moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hath obteined what ought to be taught: let vs beleue that, and lette vs firmelye holde what we ought to beleue.</hi> Nowe what that is that ought to be taught and beleued, he in his progreſſe doeth after declare. <hi>Let no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie be receiued</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>and no credit be geuen vnto it henſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furth. Becauſe nothinge ought to be added vnto auncientie. The manifeſt and well knowen faieth and credulitie of our elders, be it troubled with no permixtion of myer.</hi> Thus wrote <hi>Xiſtus</hi> and verye Apoſtolike: commending the faythe of our auncetours with the termes of perſpicuite,
<pb facs="tcp:4883:111"/>and deſcribynge prophane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties by permirtion of mier. Holye Celeſtine in maner and ſentence like, confirmed the ſame in the Epiſtle whiche he ſent vnto the prieſtes and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, blaming them for their ſilence, whereby they ſemed to geue ouer the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent faith, and ſuffered prophane nouelties to ariſe, and ſaieth. <hi>
                  <hi>Merito nos cauſa reſpicit, ſi ſilentio fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueamus errorem &amp;c.</hi> The matter tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs</hi>} (ſayeth he) <hi>if we by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence doe noriſhe and vpholde an errour. Let ſuch therfore be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, neither let it be lawfull for ſuche to ſpeake what they lyſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here ſome man may perhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes doubt, who be they whiche he forbiddeth to talke at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to ſpeake what they
<pb facs="tcp:4883:112"/>lyſt. Whether it be ment by the preachers of the auncient doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or by the deuiſers of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical nouelties. Let holy Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine hym ſelfe ſaye, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue this doubte, in whome it foloweth, <hi>
                  <hi>deſinat ſi ita res eſt.</hi> If the matter be ſo</hi> (ſaieth he) that is to witte, <hi>if it be ſo, as diuers haue blamed your prouinces and cities, for that ye through your daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſſimulynge, and hurtfull ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, cauſe them to conſent vnto certaine nouelties: If it be ſo</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>let noueltie ceſſe to vexe and diſturbe holy anncientie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſentence of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Celeſtine, which tended not to diſtroye the auncient religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to extirpe and baniſhe al newe inuentions contrarye to the catholike and old tradition
<pb facs="tcp:4883:112"/>of our forefathers. Wherfore ſuche as contemne and wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the religion taught &amp; ſet furth by the apoſtolike &amp; catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like decrees, what els doe they, but preferre theyr owne fonde fanſy &amp; iumlyng iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iuſte ſentence &amp; ſounde iudgement of ſo manye godlye fathers and holy martyrs? Firſt thei herken not to S.
